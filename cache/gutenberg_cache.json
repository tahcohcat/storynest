These apples were always counted, and about\r\nthe time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one\r\nof them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the\r\ngardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his\r\neldest son to watch; but about twelve o’clock he fell asleep, and in\r\nthe morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was\r\nordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning\r\nanother apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but\r\nthe gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come\r\nto him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself\r\nunder the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling\r\nnoise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as\r\nit was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener’s son\r\njumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm;\r\nonly it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away.\r\nThe golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the\r\ncouncil was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than\r\nall the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, ‘One feather is of no\r\nuse to me, I must have the whole bird.’\r\n\r\nThen the gardener’s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden\r\nbird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a\r\nwood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his\r\nbow and made ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said, ‘Do not shoot me,\r\nfor I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is, and\r\nthat you want to find the golden bird. You will reach a village in the\r\nevening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each\r\nother, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in\r\nthere, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you\r\nto be very poor and mean.’ But the son thought to himself, ‘What can\r\nsuch a beast as this know about the matter?’ So he shot his arrow at\r\nthe fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and\r\nran into the wood. Then he went his way, and in the evening came to\r\nthe village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people\r\nsinging, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty,\r\nand poor. ‘I should be very silly,’ said he, ‘if I went to that shabby\r\nhouse, and left this charming place’; so he went into the smart house,\r\nand ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too.\r\n\r\nTime passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings\r\nwere heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened\r\nto him. He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came\r\nto the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where\r\nthe merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not\r\nwithstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and\r\nhis country in the same manner.\r\n\r\nTime passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into\r\nthe wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not\r\nlisten to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and\r\nwas afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his\r\ncoming back. However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would\r\nnot rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard\r\nthe same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox, and did not\r\nattempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, ‘Sit upon my\r\ntail, and you will travel faster.’ So he sat down, and the fox began to\r\nrun, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair\r\nwhistled in the wind.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the village, the son followed the fox’s counsel, and\r\nwithout looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all\r\nnight at his ease. In the morning came the fox again and met him as he\r\nwas beginning his journey, and said, ‘Go straight forward, till you come\r\nto a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and\r\nsnoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and\r\non till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage;\r\nclose by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the\r\nbird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise\r\nyou will repent it.’ Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the\r\nyoung man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till\r\ntheir hair whistled in the wind.\r\n\r\nBefore the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in\r\nand found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and\r\nbelow stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been\r\nlost were lying close by it. Then thought he to himself, ‘It will be a\r\nvery droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage’; so\r\nhe opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage.\r\nBut the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and\r\nthey took him prisoner and carried him before the king. The next morning\r\nthe court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to\r\ndie, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as\r\nswiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird\r\ngiven him for his own.\r\n\r\nSo he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair,\r\nwhen on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, ‘You see now\r\nwhat has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel. I will\r\nstill, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as\r\nI bid you. You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the\r\nhorse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep\r\nand snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old\r\nleathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it.’\r\nThen the son sat down on the fox’s tail, and away they went over stock\r\nand stone till their hair whistled in the wind.\r\n\r\nAll went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden\r\nsaddle. But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a great pity\r\nto put the leathern saddle upon it. ‘I will give him the good one,’\r\nsaid he; ‘I am sure he deserves it.’ As he took up the golden saddle the\r\ngroom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran in and took\r\nhim prisoner, and in the morning he was again brought before the court\r\nto be judged, and was sentenced to die. But it was agreed, that, if he\r\ncould bring thither the beautiful princess, he should live, and have the\r\nbird and the horse given him for his own.\r\n\r\nThen he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said, ‘Why\r\ndid not you listen to me? If you had, you would have carried away\r\nboth the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel. Go\r\nstraight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle. At twelve\r\no’clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her\r\nand give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care\r\nyou do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.’\r\nThen the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock\r\nand stone till their hair whistled again.\r\n\r\nAs they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve\r\no’clock the young man met the princess going to the bath and gave her the\r\nkiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears\r\nthat he would let her take leave of her father. At first he refused,\r\nbut she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till at last\r\nhe consented; but the moment she came to her father’s house the guards\r\nawoke and he was taken prisoner again.\r\n\r\nThen he was brought before the king, and the king said, ‘You shall never\r\nhave my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops\r\nthe view from my window.’ Now this hill was so big that the whole world\r\ncould not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had\r\ndone very little, the fox came and said. ‘Lie down and go to sleep; I\r\nwill work for you.’ And in the morning he awoke and the hill was gone;\r\nso he went merrily to the king, and told him that now that it was\r\nremoved he must give him the princess.\r\n\r\nThen the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the young man\r\nand the princess; and the fox came and said to him, ‘We will have all\r\nthree, the princess, the horse, and the bird.’ ‘Ah!’ said the young man,\r\n‘that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?’\r\n\r\n‘If you will only listen,’ said the fox, ‘it can be done. When you come\r\nto the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must say, “Here\r\nshe is!” Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden\r\nhorse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of\r\nthem; but shake hands with the princess last. Then lift her quickly on\r\nto the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side, and gallop away as\r\nfast as you can.’\r\n\r\nAll went right: then the fox said, ‘When you come to the castle where\r\nthe bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will\r\nride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right\r\nhorse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that\r\nyou want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and\r\nwhen you get it into your hand, ride away.’\r\n\r\nThis, too, happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the\r\nprincess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood. Then the fox\r\ncame, and said, ‘Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.’ But the\r\nyoung man refused to do it: so the fox said, ‘I will at any rate give\r\nyou good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows,\r\nand sit down by the side of no river.’ Then away he went. ‘Well,’\r\nthought the young man, ‘it is no hard matter to keep that advice.’\r\n\r\nHe rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village where\r\nhe had left his two brothers. And there he heard a great noise and\r\nuproar; and when he asked what was the matter, the people said, ‘Two men\r\nare going to be hanged.’ As he came nearer, he saw that the two men were\r\nhis brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, ‘Cannot they in any\r\nway be saved?’ But the people said ‘No,’ unless he would bestow all his\r\nmoney upon the rascals and buy their liberty. Then he did not stay to\r\nthink about the matter, but paid what was asked, and his brothers were\r\ngiven up, and went on with him towards their home.\r\n\r\nAnd as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so\r\ncool and pleasant that the two brothers said, ‘Let us sit down by the\r\nside of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.’ So he said,\r\n‘Yes,’ and forgot the fox’s counsel, and sat down on the side of the\r\nriver; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him\r\ndown the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went\r\nhome to the king their master, and said. ‘All this have we won by our\r\nlabour.’ Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not\r\neat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept.\r\n\r\nThe youngest son fell to the bottom of the river’s bed: luckily it was\r\nnearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep\r\nthat he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once more,\r\nand scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would\r\nhave befallen him: ‘Yet,’ said he, ‘I cannot leave you here, so lay hold\r\nof my tail and hold fast.’ Then he pulled him out of the river, and said\r\nto him, as he got upon the bank, ‘Your brothers have set watch to kill\r\nyou, if they find you in the kingdom.’ So he dressed himself as a poor\r\nman, and came secretly to the king’s court, and was scarcely within the\r\ndoors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and the princess\r\nleft off weeping. Then he went to the king, and told him all his\r\nbrothers’ roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the\r\nprincess given to him again; and after the king’s death he was heir to\r\nhis kingdom.\r\n\r\nA long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox\r\nmet him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut\r\noff his head and feet. And at last he did so, and in a moment the\r\nfox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the\r\nprincess, who had been lost a great many many years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHANS IN LUCK\r\n\r\n\r\nSome men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes\r\nright--all that falls to them is so much gain--all their geese are\r\nswans--all their cards are trumps--toss them which way you will, they\r\nwill always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so\r\nmuch the faster. The world may very likely not always think of them as\r\nthey think of themselves, but what care they for the world? what can it\r\nknow about the matter?\r\n\r\nOne of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans. Seven long years he had\r\nworked hard for his master. At last he said, ‘Master, my time is up; I\r\nmust go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages\r\nand let me go.’ And the master said, ‘You have been a faithful and good\r\nservant, Hans, so your pay shall be handsome.’ Then he gave him a lump\r\nof silver as big as his head.\r\n\r\nHans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it,\r\nthrew it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards. As he\r\nwent lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight,\r\ntrotting gaily along on a capital horse. ‘Ah!’ said Hans aloud, ‘what a\r\nfine thing it is to ride on horseback! There he sits as easy and happy\r\nas if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no\r\nstones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows how.’ Hans did\r\nnot speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, ‘Well,\r\nfriend, why do you go on foot then?’ ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘I have this load to\r\ncarry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can’t hold up\r\nmy head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.’ ‘What do you say\r\nof making an exchange?’ said the horseman. ‘I will give you my horse,\r\nand you shall give me the silver; which will save you a great deal of\r\ntrouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you.’ ‘With all my\r\nheart,’ said Hans: ‘but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one\r\nthing--you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.’\r\nHowever, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him\r\nthe bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, ‘When\r\nyou want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry\r\n“Jip!”’\r\n\r\nHans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his\r\nelbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one\r\nminute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,\r\n\r\n ‘No care and no sorrow,\r\n  A fig for the morrow!\r\n  We’ll laugh and be merry,\r\n  Sing neigh down derry!’\r\n\r\nAfter a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he\r\nsmacked his lips and cried ‘Jip!’ Away went the horse full gallop; and\r\nbefore Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his\r\nback by the road-side. His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who\r\nwas coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it. Hans soon came to\r\nhimself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed, and said to the\r\nshepherd, ‘This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon\r\na beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break\r\nhis neck. However, I’m off now once for all: I like your cow now a great\r\ndeal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has\r\nspoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells\r\nnot very like a nosegay. One can walk along at one’s leisure behind that\r\ncow--keep good company, and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day,\r\ninto the bargain. What would I give to have such a prize!’ ‘Well,’ said\r\nthe shepherd, ‘if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your\r\nhorse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it\r\nmyself.’ ‘Done!’ said Hans, merrily. ‘What a noble heart that good man\r\nhas!’ thought he. Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse, wished Hans\r\nand the cow good morning, and away he rode.\r\n\r\nHans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and\r\nthen drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky\r\none. ‘If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be\r\nable to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with\r\nit; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what\r\ncan I wish for more?’ When he came to an inn, he halted, ate up all his\r\nbread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer. When he had\r\nrested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother’s\r\nvillage. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at\r\nlast, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than\r\nan hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue\r\nclave to the roof of his mouth. ‘I can find a cure for this,’ thought\r\nhe; ‘now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst’: so he tied her to the\r\nstump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop\r\nwas to be had. Who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring\r\nhim milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry? Hans had\r\nnot thought of looking to that.\r\n\r\nWhile he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very\r\nclumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at\r\nlast gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he\r\nlay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a\r\npig in a wheelbarrow. ‘What is the matter with you, my man?’ said the\r\nbutcher, as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened, how he\r\nwas dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too. Then\r\nthe butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, ‘There, drink and refresh\r\nyourself; your cow will give you no milk: don’t you see she is an old\r\nbeast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?’ ‘Alas, alas!’ said\r\nHans, ‘who would have thought it? What a shame to take my horse, and\r\ngive me only a dry cow! If I kill her, what will she be good for? I hate\r\ncow-beef; it is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig now--like\r\nthat fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease--one could do\r\nsomething with it; it would at any rate make sausages.’ ‘Well,’ said\r\nthe butcher, ‘I don’t like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind,\r\nneighbourly thing. To please you I will change, and give you my fine fat\r\npig for the cow.’ ‘Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!’\r\nsaid Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the\r\nwheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to\r\nits leg.\r\n\r\nSo on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met\r\nwith some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all.\r\nHow could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at\r\nlast got?\r\n\r\nThe next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose. The\r\ncountryman stopped to ask what was o’clock; this led to further chat;\r\nand Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and\r\nhow all the world went gay and smiling with him. The countryman then\r\nbegan to tell his tale, and said he was going to take the goose to a\r\nchristening. ‘Feel,’ said he, ‘how heavy it is, and yet it is only eight\r\nweeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it,\r\nit has lived so well!’ ‘You’re right,’ said Hans, as he weighed it in\r\nhis hand; ‘but if you talk of fat, my pig is no trifle.’ Meantime the\r\ncountryman began to look grave, and shook his head. ‘Hark ye!’ said he,\r\n‘my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so I can’t help doing\r\nyou a kind turn. Your pig may get you into a scrape. In the village I\r\njust came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty. I was\r\ndreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squire’s pig. If\r\nyou have, and they catch you, it will be a bad job for you. The least\r\nthey will do will be to throw you into the horse-pond. Can you swim?’\r\n\r\nPoor Hans was sadly frightened. ‘Good man,’ cried he, ‘pray get me out\r\nof this scrape. I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or born;\r\nbut he may have been the squire’s for aught I can tell: you know this\r\ncountry better than I do, take my pig and give me the goose.’ ‘I ought\r\nto have something into the bargain,’ said the countryman; ‘give a fat\r\ngoose for a pig, indeed! ‘Tis not everyone would do so much for you as\r\nthat. However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.’ Then\r\nhe took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path;\r\nwhile Hans went on the way homewards free from care. ‘After all,’\r\nthought he, ‘that chap is pretty well taken in. I don’t care whose pig\r\nit is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me. I\r\nhave much the best of the bargain. First there will be a capital roast;\r\nthen the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months; and then there\r\nare all the beautiful white feathers. I will put them into my pillow,\r\nand then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking. How happy my\r\nmother will be! Talk of a pig, indeed! Give me a fine fat goose.’\r\n\r\nAs he came to the next village, he saw a scissor-grinder with his wheel,\r\nworking and singing,\r\n\r\n ‘O’er hill and o’er dale\r\n  So happy I roam,\r\n  Work light and live well,\r\n  All the world is my home;\r\n  Then who so blythe, so merry as I?’\r\n\r\nHans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, ‘You must be well\r\noff, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work.’ ‘Yes,’ said the\r\nother, ‘mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand\r\ninto his pocket without finding money in it--but where did you get that\r\nbeautiful goose?’ ‘I did not buy it, I gave a pig for it.’ ‘And where\r\ndid you get the pig?’ ‘I gave a cow for it.’ ‘And the cow?’ ‘I gave a\r\nhorse for it.’ ‘And the horse?’ ‘I gave a lump of silver as big as my\r\nhead for it.’ ‘And the silver?’ ‘Oh! I worked hard for that seven long\r\nyears.’ ‘You have thriven well in the world hitherto,’ said the grinder,\r\n‘now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your hand\r\nin it, your fortune would be made.’ ‘Very true: but how is that to be\r\nmanaged?’ ‘How? Why, you must turn grinder like myself,’ said the other;\r\n‘you only want a grindstone; the rest will come of itself. Here is one\r\nthat is but little the worse for wear: I would not ask more than the\r\nvalue of your goose for it--will you buy?’ ‘How can you ask?’ said\r\nHans; ‘I should be the happiest man in the world, if I could have money\r\nwhenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I want more? there’s\r\nthe goose.’ ‘Now,’ said the grinder, as he gave him a common rough stone\r\nthat lay by his side, ‘this is a most capital stone; do but work it well\r\nenough, and you can make an old nail cut with it.’\r\n\r\nHans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes\r\nsparkled for joy, and he said to himself, ‘Surely I must have been born\r\nin a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself.\r\nPeople are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a favour in\r\nletting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains.’\r\n\r\nMeantime he began to be tired, and hungry too, for he had given away his\r\nlast penny in his joy at getting the cow.\r\n\r\nAt last he could go no farther, for the stone tired him sadly: and he\r\ndragged himself to the side of a river, that he might take a drink of\r\nwater, and rest a while. So he laid the stone carefully by his side on\r\nthe bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a\r\nlittle, and down it rolled, plump into the stream.\r\n\r\nFor a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang\r\nup and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven,\r\nwith tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his only plague,\r\nthe ugly heavy stone.\r\n\r\n‘How happy am I!’ cried he; ‘nobody was ever so lucky as I.’ Then up he\r\ngot with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till\r\nhe reached his mother’s house, and told her how very easy the road to\r\ngood luck was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJORINDA AND JORINDEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy\r\nwood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take\r\nany shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of\r\nan owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always\r\nbecame an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred\r\npaces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step\r\ntill she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given\r\nher his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came\r\nwithin that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her\r\ninto a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were\r\nseven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle, and all with\r\nbeautiful birds in them.\r\n\r\nNow there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier\r\nthan all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd\r\nlad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon\r\nto be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be\r\nalone; and Jorindel said, ‘We must take care that we don’t go too near\r\nto the fairy’s castle.’ It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the\r\nsetting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon\r\nthe green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall\r\nbirches.\r\n\r\nJorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and\r\nboth felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be\r\nparted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when\r\nthey looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves\r\nat a loss to know what path to take.\r\n\r\nThe sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind\r\nthe hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the\r\nbushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old\r\nwalls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled.\r\nJorinda was just singing,\r\n\r\n ‘The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,\r\n  Well-a-day! Well-a-day!\r\n  He mourn’d for the fate of his darling mate,\r\n  Well-a-day!’\r\n\r\nwhen her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and\r\nbeheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended\r\nwith a mournful _jug, jug_. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times\r\nround them, and three times screamed:\r\n\r\n ‘Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!’\r\n\r\nJorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither\r\nweep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down;\r\nthe gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the\r\nold fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and\r\nchin that almost met one another.\r\n\r\nShe mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away\r\nwith it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone--but\r\nwhat could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the spot\r\nwhere he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n ‘Till the prisoner is fast,\r\n  And her doom is cast,\r\n  There stay! Oh, stay!\r\n  When the charm is around her,\r\n  And the spell has bound her,\r\n  Hie away! away!’\r\n\r\nOn a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees\r\nbefore the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but\r\nshe laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she\r\nwent her way.\r\n\r\nHe prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. ‘Alas!’ he said, ‘what\r\nwill become of me?’ He could not go back to his own home, so he went to\r\na strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time\r\ndid he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go,\r\nbut all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.\r\n\r\nAt last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower,\r\nand that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he\r\nplucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and\r\nthat everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he\r\nfound his Jorinda again.\r\n\r\nIn the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for\r\nthis pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but\r\non the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple\r\nflower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly\r\npearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and\r\nnight, till he came again to the castle.\r\n\r\nHe walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become\r\nfixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door.\r\nJorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with\r\nthe flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court,\r\nand listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the\r\nchamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in\r\nthe seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and\r\nscreamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for\r\nthe flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at\r\nthe birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then\r\nshould he find out which was his Jorinda? While he was thinking what to\r\ndo, he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the\r\nbest of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her, touched\r\nthe cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her\r\narms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when\r\nthey walked together in the wood.\r\n\r\nThen he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all\r\ntook their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were\r\nmarried, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many\r\nother lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy’s\r\ncages by themselves, much longer than they liked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRAVELLING MUSICIANS\r\n\r\n\r\nAn honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him\r\na great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more\r\nunfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and\r\nbegan to think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some\r\nmischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey\r\ntowards the great city, ‘For there,’ thought he, ‘I may turn musician.’\r\n\r\nAfter he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the\r\nroadside and panting as if he were tired. ‘What makes you pant so, my\r\nfriend?’ said the ass. ‘Alas!’ said the dog, ‘my master was going to\r\nknock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make\r\nmyself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to\r\nearn my livelihood?’ ‘Hark ye!’ said the ass, ‘I am going to the great\r\ncity to turn musician: suppose you go with me, and try what you can\r\ndo in the same way?’ The dog said he was willing, and they jogged on\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThey had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the\r\nroad and making a most rueful face. ‘Pray, my good lady,’ said the ass,\r\n‘what’s the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!’ ‘Ah, me!’\r\nsaid the cat, ‘how can one be in good spirits when one’s life is in\r\ndanger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my\r\nease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress\r\nlaid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky\r\nenough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.’\r\n‘Oh,’ said the ass, ‘by all means go with us to the great city; you are\r\na good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.’ The cat\r\nwas pleased with the thought, and joined the party.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock\r\nperched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main.\r\n‘Bravo!’ said the ass; ‘upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what\r\nis all this about?’ ‘Why,’ said the cock, ‘I was just now saying that\r\nwe should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and\r\nthe cook don’t thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my\r\nhead tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming\r\non Sunday!’ ‘Heaven forbid!’ said the ass, ‘come with us Master\r\nChanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have\r\nyour head cut off! Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we\r\nmay get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.’ ‘With all my\r\nheart,’ said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.\r\n\r\nThey could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when\r\nnight came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laid\r\nthemselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the\r\nbranches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he\r\nshould be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to\r\nhis custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to\r\nsee that everything was well. In doing this, he saw afar off something\r\nbright and shining and calling to his companions said, ‘There must be a\r\nhouse no great way off, for I see a light.’ ‘If that be the case,’ said\r\nthe ass, ‘we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the\r\nbest in the world!’ ‘Besides,’ added the dog, ‘I should not be the\r\nworse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.’ So they walked off together\r\ntowards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew\r\nnear it became larger and brighter, till they at last came close to a\r\nhouse in which a gang of robbers lived.\r\n\r\nThe ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and\r\npeeped in. ‘Well, Donkey,’ said Chanticleer, ‘what do you see?’ ‘What\r\ndo I see?’ replied the ass. ‘Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of\r\ngood things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.’ ‘That would\r\nbe a noble lodging for us,’ said the cock. ‘Yes,’ said the ass, ‘if we\r\ncould only get in’; so they consulted together how they should contrive\r\nto get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placed\r\nhimself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the\r\nwindow; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog’s\r\nshoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat’s head. When\r\nall was ready a signal was given, and they began their music. The ass\r\nbrayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then\r\nthey all broke through the window at once, and came tumbling into\r\nthe room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter! The\r\nrobbers, who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert,\r\nhad now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them,\r\nand scampered away as fast as they could.\r\n\r\nThe coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what\r\nthe robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected\r\nto eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves, they\r\nput out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to\r\nhis own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in\r\nthe yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the\r\ncat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the\r\ncock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and, as they were all\r\nrather tired with their journey, they soon fell asleep.\r\n\r\nBut about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were\r\nout and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in\r\ntoo great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than\r\nthe rest, went to see what was going on. Finding everything still, he\r\nmarched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in\r\norder to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of\r\nthe cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to\r\nlight it. But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face,\r\nand spat, and scratched at him. This frightened him dreadfully, and away\r\nhe ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the\r\nleg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the\r\ncock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might. At\r\nthis the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told\r\nthe captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at\r\nhim and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a\r\nknife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him\r\nin the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a\r\nclub, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out,\r\n‘Throw the rascal up here!’ After this the robbers never dared to go\r\nback to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters\r\nthat they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at\r\nthis very day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD SULTAN\r\n\r\n\r\nA shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old,\r\nand had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife\r\nwere standing together before the house the shepherd said, ‘I will shoot\r\nold Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.’ But his wife\r\nsaid, ‘Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a\r\ngreat many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of\r\nhis days.’ ‘But what can we do with him?’ said the shepherd, ‘he has not\r\na tooth in his head, and the thieves don’t care for him at all; to\r\nbe sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood;\r\ntomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.’\r\n\r\nPoor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd\r\nand his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think\r\ntomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good\r\nfriend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows,\r\nand how his master meant to kill him in the morning. ‘Make yourself\r\neasy,’ said the wolf, ‘I will give you some good advice. Your master,\r\nyou know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the\r\nfield; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down\r\nbehind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie\r\ndown close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come\r\nout of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as\r\nyou can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they\r\nwill think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you\r\nthat they will take care of you as long as you live.’ The dog liked this\r\nplan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the\r\nchild a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan\r\nsoon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master\r\nand mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, ‘Old\r\nSultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live\r\nand be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and\r\ngive him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on\r\nas long as he lives.’ So from this time forward Sultan had all that he\r\ncould wish for.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, ‘Now, my\r\ngood fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way\r\nwhen I want to taste one of the old shepherd’s fine fat sheep.’ ‘No,’\r\nsaid the Sultan; ‘I will be true to my master.’ However, the wolf\r\nthought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But\r\nSultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait\r\nfor him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for\r\na good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed\r\nhis locks for him finely.\r\n\r\nThen the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan ‘an old rogue,’ and\r\nswore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the\r\nboar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now\r\nSultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd’s old\r\nthree-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped\r\nalong with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.\r\n\r\nThe wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they\r\nespied their enemies coming, and saw the cat’s long tail standing\r\nstraight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to\r\nfight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up\r\na stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of\r\nfighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped\r\nup into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and\r\nwondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden\r\nhimself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of\r\nthem a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a\r\nmouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped\r\nup and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ‘Look up in the tree, there\r\nsits the one who is to blame.’ So they looked up, and espied the wolf\r\nsitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,\r\nand would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of\r\nhimself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRAW, THE COAL, AND THE BEAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish\r\nof beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and\r\nthat it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw.\r\nWhen she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her\r\nobserving it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards\r\na burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw\r\nbegan and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?’ The coal\r\nreplied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped\r\nby sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been\r\nburnt to ashes.’ The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin,\r\nbut if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made\r\ninto broth without any mercy, like my comrades.’ ‘And would a better\r\nfate have fallen to my lot?’ said the straw. ‘The old woman has\r\ndestroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at\r\nonce, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.’\r\n\r\n‘But what are we to do now?’ said the coal.\r\n\r\n‘I think,’ answered the bean, ‘that as we have so fortunately escaped\r\ndeath, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new\r\nmischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and\r\nrepair to a foreign country.’\r\n\r\nThe proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way\r\ntogether. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was\r\nno bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over\r\nit. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: ‘I will lay myself straight\r\nacross, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.’ The straw\r\ntherefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal,\r\nwho was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the\r\nnewly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the\r\nwater rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still,\r\nand ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in\r\ntwo pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed\r\nwhen she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had\r\nprudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event,\r\nwas unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would\r\nhave been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who\r\nwas travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook.\r\nAs he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread,\r\nand sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the\r\ntailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIAR ROSE\r\n\r\n\r\nA king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off,\r\nwhere there were in those days fairies. Now this king and queen had\r\nplenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of\r\ngood things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but\r\nthough they had been married many years they had no children, and this\r\ngrieved them very much indeed. But one day as the queen was walking\r\nby the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor\r\nlittle fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping\r\nand nearly dead on the bank. Then the queen took pity on the little\r\nfish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away\r\nit lifted its head out of the water and said, ‘I know what your wish is,\r\nand it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will\r\nsoon have a daughter.’ What the little fish had foretold soon came to\r\npass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king\r\ncould not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great\r\nfeast and make merry, and show the child to all the land. So he asked\r\nhis kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and neighbours. But the queen\r\nsaid, ‘I will have the fairies also, that they might be kind and good\r\nto our little daughter.’ Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom;\r\nbut as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat\r\nout of, they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her.\r\nSo twelve fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, and red\r\nshoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand:\r\nand after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all\r\ntheir best gifts to the little princess. One gave her goodness, another\r\nbeauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nJust as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in\r\nthe courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was\r\ncome, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a\r\nbroomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-hall.\r\nNow, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and\r\nscolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her\r\nrevenge. So she cried out, ‘The king’s daughter shall, in her fifteenth\r\nyear, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.’ Then the twelfth of\r\nthe friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and\r\nsaid that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its\r\nmischief; so her gift was, that the king’s daughter, when the spindle\r\nwounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a\r\nhundred years.\r\n\r\nHowever, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from\r\nthe threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom\r\nshould be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven\r\nfairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so\r\nbeautiful, and well behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who knew\r\nher loved her.\r\n\r\nIt happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the king\r\nand queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she\r\nroved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till\r\nat last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase\r\nending with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when\r\nshe turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning\r\naway very busily. ‘Why, how now, good mother,’ said the princess; ‘what\r\nare you doing there?’ ‘Spinning,’ said the old lady, and nodded her\r\nhead, humming a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. ‘How prettily that\r\nlittle thing turns round!’ said the princess, and took the spindle\r\nand began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched it, before the\r\nfairy’s prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell\r\ndown lifeless on the ground.\r\n\r\nHowever, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and\r\nthe king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court,\r\nfell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in\r\nthe court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon\r\nthe walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to\r\nsleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a\r\ngoose upon it for the king’s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was\r\nat that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box\r\non the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell\r\nasleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the\r\njug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.\r\n\r\nA large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every year it\r\nbecame higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded\r\nand hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But\r\nthere went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar\r\nRose (for so the king’s daughter was called): so that, from time to\r\ntime, several kings’ sons came, and tried to break through the thicket\r\ninto the palace. This, however, none of them could ever do; for the\r\nthorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there\r\nthey stuck fast, and died wretchedly.\r\n\r\nAfter many, many years there came a king’s son into that land: and an\r\nold man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful\r\npalace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess, called Briar Rose,\r\nlay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard\r\nfrom his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to\r\nbreak through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and\r\ndied. Then the young prince said, ‘All this shall not frighten me; I\r\nwill go and see this Briar Rose.’ The old man tried to hinder him, but\r\nhe was bent upon going.\r\n\r\nNow that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came\r\nto the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through\r\nwhich he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever.\r\nThen he came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs\r\nasleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat\r\nthe pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. And when he\r\ncame into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit\r\nwas standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going\r\nto drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be\r\nplucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as\r\nif she was going to beat the boy.\r\n\r\nThen he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear\r\nevery breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and opened\r\nthe door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay,\r\nfast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that he\r\ncould not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.\r\nBut the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled\r\nupon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also\r\nawoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder.\r\nAnd the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the\r\npigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and\r\nflew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in\r\nthe kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit,\r\nwith the goose for the king’s dinner upon it; the butler finished his\r\ndraught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave\r\nthe boy the box on his ear.\r\n\r\nAnd then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast\r\nwas given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOG AND THE SPARROW\r\n\r\n\r\nA shepherd’s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him\r\nsuffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he\r\ntook to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.\r\nOn the road he met a sparrow that said to him, ‘Why are you so sad,\r\nmy friend?’ ‘Because,’ said the dog, ‘I am very very hungry, and have\r\nnothing to eat.’ ‘If that be all,’ answered the sparrow, ‘come with me\r\ninto the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.’ So on they\r\nwent together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher’s shop,\r\nthe sparrow said to the dog, ‘Stand there a little while till I peck you\r\ndown a piece of meat.’ So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having\r\nfirst looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she\r\npecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf,\r\ntill at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled\r\naway with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. ‘Well,’ said\r\nthe sparrow, ‘you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to\r\nthe next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.’ When the dog had\r\neaten this too, the sparrow said to him, ‘Well, my good friend, have you\r\nhad enough now?’ ‘I have had plenty of meat,’ answered he, ‘but I should\r\nlike to have a piece of bread to eat after it.’ ‘Come with me then,’\r\nsaid the sparrow, ‘and you shall soon have that too.’ So she took him\r\nto a baker’s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till\r\nthey fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to\r\nanother shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the\r\nsparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. ‘Yes,’ said he; ‘and\r\nnow let us take a walk a little way out of the town.’ So they both went\r\nout upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone\r\nfar before the dog said, ‘I am very much tired--I should like to take a\r\nnap.’ ‘Very well,’ answered the sparrow, ‘do so, and in the meantime\r\nI will perch upon that bush.’ So the dog stretched himself out on the\r\nroad, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with\r\na cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The\r\nsparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would\r\ngo on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called\r\nout, ‘Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.’ But the\r\ncarter, grumbling to himself, ‘You make it the worse for me, indeed!\r\nwhat can you do?’ cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor\r\ndog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. ‘There,’ cried the\r\nsparrow, ‘thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now\r\nmind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.’\r\n‘Do your worst, and welcome,’ said the brute, ‘what harm can you do me?’\r\nand passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and\r\npecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then\r\nall the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked\r\nround, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty.\r\n‘What an unlucky wretch I am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said\r\nthe sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and\r\npecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this,\r\nhe drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill\r\nher; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse’s head\r\nwith such force, that he fell down dead. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’\r\ncried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow. And as the carter\r\nwent on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the\r\ncart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine\r\nran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, ‘Miserable wretch\r\nthat I am!’ But the sparrow answered, ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ and\r\nperched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The\r\ncarter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she\r\nflew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the\r\nspot. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ said he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said\r\nthe sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him\r\ntoo. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or\r\ncaring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his\r\nthird horse as he done the other two. ‘Alas! miserable wretch that I\r\nam!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ answered the sparrow as she flew\r\naway; ‘now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.’ The\r\ncarter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home\r\noverflowing with rage and vexation. ‘Alas!’ said he to his wife, ‘what\r\nill luck has befallen me!--my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three\r\ndead.’ ‘Alas! husband,’ replied she, ‘and a wicked bird has come into\r\nthe house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am\r\nsure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it\r\nup at such a rate!’ Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of\r\nbirds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the\r\nmidst of them. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ cried the carter; for he saw\r\nthat the corn was almost all gone. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the\r\nsparrow; ‘thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!’ and away she flew.\r\n\r\nThe carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down\r\ninto his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat\r\nhimself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat\r\non the outside of the window, and cried ‘Carter! thy cruelty shall cost\r\nthee thy life!’ With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet,\r\nand threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the\r\nwindow. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and\r\ncried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!’ Then he became mad and\r\nblind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he\r\ncleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter\r\nand his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture,\r\nglasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without\r\ntouching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the\r\nwife said, ‘Shall I kill her at once?’ ‘No,’ cried he, ‘that is letting\r\nher off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat\r\nher.’ But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck\r\nand cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!’ With that he\r\ncould wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, ‘Wife,\r\nstrike at the bird and kill her in my hand.’ And the wife struck; but\r\nshe missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down\r\ndead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept in\r\ntwelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were\r\nshut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite\r\nworn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody\r\ncould find out how it happened, or where they had been.\r\n\r\nThen the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could\r\ndiscover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses\r\ndanced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his\r\nwife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not\r\nsucceed, after three days and nights, should be put to death.\r\n\r\nA king’s son soon came. He was well entertained, and in the evening was\r\ntaken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their\r\ntwelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance;\r\nand, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door\r\nof his chamber was left open. But the king’s son soon fell asleep; and\r\nwhen he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been\r\ndancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. The same thing\r\nhappened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be\r\ncut off. After him came several others; but they had all the same luck,\r\nand all lost their lives in the same manner.\r\n\r\nNow it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle\r\nand could fight no longer, passed through the country where this king\r\nreigned: and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman,\r\nwho asked him where he was going. ‘I hardly know where I am going, or\r\nwhat I had better do,’ said the soldier; ‘but I think I should like very\r\nwell to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time\r\nI might be a king.’ ‘Well,’ said the old dame, ‘that is no very hard\r\ntask: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the\r\nprincesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves\r\nyou pretend to be fast asleep.’\r\n\r\nThen she gave him a cloak, and said, ‘As soon as you put that on\r\nyou will become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the\r\nprincesses wherever they go.’ When the soldier heard all this good\r\ncounsel, he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and said\r\nhe was willing to undertake the task.\r\n\r\nHe was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered\r\nfine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led\r\nto the outer chamber. Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of\r\nthe princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all\r\naway secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself\r\ndown on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if\r\nhe was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed\r\nheartily; and the eldest said, ‘This fellow too might have done a wiser\r\nthing than lose his life in this way!’ Then they rose up and opened\r\ntheir drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and\r\ndressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager\r\nto begin dancing. But the youngest said, ‘I don’t know how it is, while\r\nyou are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some mischance will\r\nbefall us.’ ‘You simpleton,’ said the eldest, ‘you are always afraid;\r\nhave you forgotten how many kings’ sons have already watched in vain?\r\nAnd as for this soldier, even if I had not given him his sleeping\r\ndraught, he would have slept soundly enough.’\r\n\r\nWhen they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he\r\nsnored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were\r\nquite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands,\r\nand the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open. The soldier\r\nsaw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest\r\nleading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put\r\non the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them;\r\nbut in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest\r\nprincess, and she cried out to her sisters, ‘All is not right; someone\r\ntook hold of my gown.’ ‘You silly creature!’ said the eldest, ‘it is\r\nnothing but a nail in the wall.’ Then down they all went, and at the\r\nbottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees; and\r\nthe leaves were all of silver, and glittered and sparkled beautifully.\r\nThe soldier wished to take away some token of the place; so he broke\r\noff a little branch, and there came a loud noise from the tree. Then the\r\nyoungest daughter said again, ‘I am sure all is not right--did not you\r\nhear that noise? That never happened before.’ But the eldest said, ‘It\r\nis only our princes, who are shouting for joy at our approach.’\r\n\r\nThen they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of\r\ngold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering\r\ndiamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there\r\nwas a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but\r\nthe eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy.\r\nSo they went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the\r\nlake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them,\r\nwho seemed to be waiting there for the princesses.\r\n\r\nOne of the princesses went into each boat, and the soldier stepped into\r\nthe same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the lake, the\r\nprince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier\r\nsaid, ‘I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing with all my might\r\nwe do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat\r\nseems very heavy today.’ ‘It is only the heat of the weather,’ said the\r\nprincess: ‘I feel it very warm too.’\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from\r\nwhich came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all landed,\r\nand went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and\r\nthe soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and\r\nwhen any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it\r\nall up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty. At this,\r\ntoo, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always\r\nsilenced her. They danced on till three o’clock in the morning, and then\r\nall their shoes were worn out, so that they were obliged to leave off.\r\nThe princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the\r\nsoldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the\r\nopposite shore they took leave of each other, the princesses promising\r\nto come again the next night.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the princesses,\r\nand laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very\r\nmuch tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said, ‘Now all\r\nis quite safe’; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine\r\nclothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed. In the morning the\r\nsoldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more\r\nof this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night;\r\nand every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time\r\ntill their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home. However,\r\non the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a\r\ntoken of where he had been.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret, he was taken\r\nbefore the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the\r\ntwelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would\r\nsay. And when the king asked him. ‘Where do my twelve daughters dance at\r\nnight?’ he answered, ‘With twelve princes in a castle under ground.’ And\r\nthen he told the king all that had happened, and showed him the three\r\nbranches and the golden cup which he had brought with him. Then the king\r\ncalled for the princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said\r\nwas true: and when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was\r\nof no use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all. And the king\r\nasked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife; and he\r\nanswered, ‘I am not very young, so I will have the eldest.’--And they\r\nwere married that very day, and the soldier was chosen to be the king’s\r\nheir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FISHERMAN AND HIS WIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close\r\nby the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and\r\none day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling\r\nwaves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was dragged away\r\ndeep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish.\r\nBut the fish said, ‘Pray let me live! I am not a real fish; I am an\r\nenchanted prince: put me in the water again, and let me go!’ ‘Oh, ho!’\r\nsaid the man, ‘you need not make so many words about the matter; I will\r\nhave nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so swim away, sir, as soon\r\nas you please!’ Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted\r\nstraight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him\r\non the wave.\r\n\r\nWhen the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty, he told her how\r\nhe had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted\r\nprince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go again. ‘Did not\r\nyou ask it for anything?’ said the wife, ‘we live very wretchedly here,\r\nin this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug\r\nlittle cottage.’\r\n\r\nThe fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the\r\nseashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and\r\ngreen. And he stood at the water’s edge, and said:\r\n\r\n ‘O man of the sea!\r\n  Hearken to me!\r\n  My wife Ilsabill\r\n  Will have her own will,\r\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\r\n\r\nThen the fish came swimming to him, and said, ‘Well, what is her will?\r\nWhat does your wife want?’ ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘she says that when\r\nI had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let\r\nyou go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants\r\na snug little cottage.’ ‘Go home, then,’ said the fish; ‘she is in the\r\ncottage already!’ So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the\r\ndoor of a nice trim little cottage. ‘Come in, come in!’ said she; ‘is\r\nnot this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?’ And there was a\r\nparlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there\r\nwas a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and\r\nthere was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens. ‘Ah!’ said the\r\nfisherman, ‘how happily we shall live now!’ ‘We will try to do so, at\r\nleast,’ said his wife.\r\n\r\nEverything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill said,\r\n‘Husband, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the\r\ncourtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; I should like to\r\nhave a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him\r\nto give us a castle.’ ‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘I don’t like to go to\r\nhim again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this\r\npretty cottage to live in.’ ‘Nonsense!’ said the wife; ‘he will do it\r\nvery willingly, I know; go along and try!’\r\n\r\nThe fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to\r\nthe sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he went\r\nclose to the edge of the waves, and said:\r\n\r\n ‘O man of the sea!\r\n  Hearken to me!\r\n  My wife Ilsabill\r\n  Will have her own will,\r\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\r\n\r\n‘Well, what does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the man,\r\ndolefully, ‘my wife wants to live in a stone castle.’ ‘Go home, then,’\r\nsaid the fish; ‘she is standing at the gate of it already.’ So away went\r\nthe fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great\r\ncastle. ‘See,’ said she, ‘is not this grand?’ With that they went into\r\nthe castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the\r\nrooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and\r\nbehind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a\r\nmile long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the\r\ncourtyard were stables and cow-houses. ‘Well,’ said the man, ‘now we\r\nwill live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of\r\nour lives.’ ‘Perhaps we may,’ said the wife; ‘but let us sleep upon it,\r\nbefore we make up our minds to that.’ So they went to bed.\r\n\r\nThe next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and\r\nshe jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, ‘Get up, husband,\r\nand bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land.’ ‘Wife, wife,’\r\nsaid the man, ‘why should we wish to be the king? I will not be king.’\r\n‘Then I will,’ said she. ‘But, wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘how can you\r\nbe king--the fish cannot make you a king?’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘say\r\nno more about it, but go and try! I will be king.’ So the man went away\r\nquite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. This time\r\nthe sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves\r\nand the ridges of foam as he cried out:\r\n\r\n ‘O man of the sea!\r\n  Hearken to me!\r\n  My wife Ilsabill\r\n  Will have her own will,\r\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\r\n\r\n‘Well, what would she have now?’ said the fish. ‘Alas!’ said the poor\r\nman, ‘my wife wants to be king.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is king\r\nalready.’\r\n\r\nThen the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw\r\na troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. And when\r\nhe went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds,\r\nwith a golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her stood six\r\nfair maidens, each a head taller than the other. ‘Well, wife,’ said the\r\nfisherman, ‘are you king?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am king.’ And when he had\r\nlooked at her for a long time, he said, ‘Ah, wife! what a fine thing it\r\nis to be king! Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long\r\nas we live.’ ‘I don’t know how that may be,’ said she; ‘never is a long\r\ntime. I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I\r\nthink I should like to be emperor.’ ‘Alas, wife! why should you wish to\r\nbe emperor?’ said the fisherman. ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘go to the fish!\r\nI say I will be emperor.’ ‘Ah, wife!’ replied the fisherman, ‘the fish\r\ncannot make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for\r\nsuch a thing.’ ‘I am king,’ said Ilsabill, ‘and you are my slave; so go\r\nat once!’\r\n\r\nSo the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along,\r\n‘This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be\r\ntired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.’ He\r\nsoon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and\r\na mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he\r\nwent as near as he could to the water’s brink, and said:\r\n\r\n ‘O man of the sea!\r\n  Hearken to me!\r\n  My wife Ilsabill\r\n  Will have her own will,\r\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\r\n\r\n‘What would she have now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman,\r\n‘she wants to be emperor.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is emperor\r\nalready.’\r\n\r\nSo he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill\r\nsitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on\r\nher head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards\r\nand attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the\r\ntallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. And\r\nbefore her stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the fisherman went\r\nup to her and said, ‘Wife, are you emperor?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am\r\nemperor.’ ‘Ah!’ said the man, as he gazed upon her, ‘what a fine thing\r\nit is to be emperor!’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘why should we stop at being\r\nemperor? I will be pope next.’ ‘O wife, wife!’ said he, ‘how can you be\r\npope? there is but one pope at a time in Christendom.’ ‘Husband,’ said\r\nshe, ‘I will be pope this very day.’ ‘But,’ replied the husband, ‘the\r\nfish cannot make you pope.’ ‘What nonsense!’ said she; ‘if he can make\r\nan emperor, he can make a pope: go and try him.’\r\n\r\nSo the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind was raging\r\nand the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves, and the ships were\r\nin trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows. In the\r\nmiddle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky, but towards\r\nthe south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising. At this sight\r\nthe fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his\r\nknees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n ‘O man of the sea!\r\n  Hearken to me!\r\n  My wife Ilsabill\r\n  Will have her own will,\r\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\r\n\r\n‘What does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘my\r\nwife wants to be pope.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is pope already.’\r\n\r\nThen the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill sitting on a throne\r\nthat was two miles high. And she had three great crowns on her head, and\r\naround her stood all the pomp and power of the Church. And on each side\r\nof her were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the greatest as\r\nlarge as the highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no\r\nlarger than a small rushlight. ‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, as he looked\r\nat all this greatness, ‘are you pope?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am pope.’\r\n‘Well, wife,’ replied he, ‘it is a grand thing to be pope; and now\r\nyou must be easy, for you can be nothing greater.’ ‘I will think about\r\nthat,’ said the wife. Then they went to bed: but Dame Ilsabill could not\r\nsleep all night for thinking what she should be next. At last, as she\r\nwas dropping asleep, morning broke, and the sun rose. ‘Ha!’ thought she,\r\nas she woke up and looked at it through the window, ‘after all I cannot\r\nprevent the sun rising.’ At this thought she was very angry, and wakened\r\nher husband, and said, ‘Husband, go to the fish and tell him I must\r\nbe lord of the sun and moon.’ The fisherman was half asleep, but the\r\nthought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed.\r\n‘Alas, wife!’ said he, ‘cannot you be easy with being pope?’ ‘No,’\r\nsaid she, ‘I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my\r\nleave. Go to the fish at once!’\r\n\r\nThen the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to\r\nthe shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks\r\nshook. And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds, and the\r\nlightnings played, and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in\r\nthe sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of\r\nwhite foam upon their heads. And the fisherman crept towards the sea,\r\nand cried out, as well as he could:\r\n\r\n ‘O man of the sea!\r\n  Hearken to me!\r\n  My wife Ilsabill\r\n  Will have her own will,\r\n  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’\r\n\r\n‘What does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘she wants to\r\nbe lord of the sun and moon.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish, ‘to your pigsty\r\nagain.’\r\n\r\nAnd there they live to this very day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WILLOW-WREN AND THE BEAR\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest,\r\nand the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said: ‘Brother\r\nwolf, what bird is it that sings so well?’ ‘That is the King of birds,’\r\nsaid the wolf, ‘before whom we must bow down.’ In reality the bird was\r\nthe willow-wren. ‘IF that’s the case,’ said the bear, ‘I should very\r\nmuch like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.’ ‘That is not\r\ndone quite as you seem to think,’ said the wolf; ‘you must wait until\r\nthe Queen comes,’ Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in\r\nher beak, and the lord King came too, and they began to feed their young\r\nones. The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him\r\nback by the sleeve, and said: ‘No, you must wait until the lord and lady\r\nQueen have gone away again.’ So they took stock of the hole where the\r\nnest lay, and trotted away. The bear, however, could not rest until he\r\nhad seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it\r\nagain. The King and Queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw\r\nfive or six young ones lying there. ‘Is that the royal palace?’ cried\r\nthe bear; ‘it is a wretched palace, and you are not King’s children, you\r\nare disreputable children!’ When the young wrens heard that, they were\r\nfrightfully angry, and screamed: ‘No, that we are not! Our parents are\r\nhonest people! Bear, you will have to pay for that!’\r\n\r\nThe bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their\r\nholes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and\r\nwhen their parents again brought food they said: ‘We will not so much as\r\ntouch one fly’s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have\r\nsettled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been\r\nhere and has insulted us!’ Then the old King said: ‘Be easy, he shall\r\nbe punished,’ and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear’s cave, and\r\ncalled in: ‘Old Growler, why have you insulted my children? You shall\r\nsuffer for it--we will punish you by a bloody war.’ Thus war was\r\nannounced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take\r\npart in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth\r\ncontained. And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the\r\nair, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and\r\nflies had to come.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies\r\nto discover who was the enemy’s commander-in-chief. The gnat, who was\r\nthe most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled,\r\nand hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be\r\nannounced. There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him\r\nand said: ‘Fox, you are the most cunning of all animals, you shall be\r\ngeneral and lead us.’ ‘Good,’ said the fox, ‘but what signal shall we\r\nagree upon?’ No one knew that, so the fox said: ‘I have a fine long\r\nbushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers. When I lift\r\nmy tail up quite high, all is going well, and you must charge; but if I\r\nlet it hang down, run away as fast as you can.’ When the gnat had heard\r\nthat, she flew away again, and revealed everything, down to the minutest\r\ndetail, to the willow-wren. When day broke, and the battle was to begin,\r\nall the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the\r\nearth trembled. The willow-wren with his army also came flying through\r\nthe air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one\r\nwas uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each\r\nother. But the willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to settle\r\nbeneath the fox’s tail, and sting with all his might. When the fox felt\r\nthe first string, he started so that he lifted one leg, from pain, but\r\nhe bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second\r\nsting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could\r\nhold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs. When\r\nthe animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began to flee, each\r\ninto his hole, and the birds had won the battle.\r\n\r\nThen the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried:\r\n‘Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart’s content, we have won\r\nthe battle!’ But the young wrens said: ‘We will not eat yet, the bear\r\nmust come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are honourable\r\nchildren, before we will do that.’ Then the willow-wren flew to the\r\nbear’s hole and cried: ‘Growler, you are to come to the nest to my\r\nchildren, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your body shall\r\nbe broken.’ So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged\r\ntheir pardon. And now at last the young wrens were satisfied, and sat\r\ndown together and ate and drank, and made merry till quite late into the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FROG-PRINCE\r\n\r\n\r\nOne fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went\r\nout to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool\r\nspring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down\r\nto rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her\r\nfavourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and\r\ncatching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that\r\nshe missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled\r\nalong upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The\r\nprincess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so\r\ndeep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail\r\nher loss, and said, ‘Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would\r\ngive all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the\r\nworld.’\r\n\r\nWhilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,\r\n‘Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘what can you\r\ndo for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.’\r\nThe frog said, ‘I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes;\r\nbut if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off\r\nyour golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball\r\nagain.’ ‘What nonsense,’ thought the princess, ‘this silly frog is\r\ntalking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though\r\nhe may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he\r\nshall have what he asks.’ So she said to the frog, ‘Well, if you will\r\nbring me my ball, I will do all you ask.’ Then the frog put his head\r\ndown, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came\r\nup again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the\r\nspring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick\r\nit up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she\r\nnever thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.\r\nThe frog called after her, ‘Stay, princess, and take me with you as you\r\nsaid,’ But she did not stop to hear a word.\r\n\r\nThe next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a\r\nstrange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the\r\nmarble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the\r\ndoor, and a little voice cried out and said:\r\n\r\n ‘Open the door, my princess dear,\r\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\r\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\r\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’\r\n\r\nThen the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw\r\nthe frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly\r\nfrightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her\r\nseat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her,\r\nasked her what was the matter. ‘There is a nasty frog,’ said she, ‘at\r\nthe door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I\r\ntold him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never\r\nget out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come\r\nin.’\r\n\r\nWhile she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:\r\n\r\n ‘Open the door, my princess dear,\r\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\r\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\r\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’\r\n\r\nThen the king said to the young princess, ‘As you have given your word\r\nyou must keep it; so go and let him in.’ She did so, and the frog hopped\r\ninto the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the\r\nbottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where\r\nthe princess sat. ‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he to the princess,\r\n‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as she had done this, the frog\r\nsaid, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’ This\r\nshe did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ‘Now I am\r\ntired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’ And the princess,\r\nthough very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the\r\npillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was\r\nlight he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.\r\n‘Now, then,’ thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone, and I shall be\r\ntroubled with him no more.’\r\n\r\nBut she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same\r\ntapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:\r\n\r\n ‘Open the door, my princess dear,\r\n  Open the door to thy true love here!\r\n  And mind the words that thou and I said\r\n  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’\r\n\r\nAnd when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon\r\nher pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did\r\nthe same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was\r\nastonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her\r\nwith the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head\r\nof her bed.\r\n\r\nHe told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had\r\nchanged him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till\r\nsome princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from\r\nher plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. ‘You,’ said the\r\nprince, ‘have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for\r\nbut that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where I will\r\nmarry you, and love you as long as you live.’\r\n\r\nThe young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’ to\r\nall this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful\r\nhorses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind\r\nthe coach rode the prince’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed\r\nthe misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so\r\nbitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.\r\n\r\nThey then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight\r\nhorses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince’s\r\nkingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great\r\nmany years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAT AND MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nA certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much\r\nto her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at\r\nlength the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.\r\n‘But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer\r\nfrom hunger,’ said the cat; ‘and you, little mouse, cannot venture\r\neverywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.’ The good advice\r\nwas followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where\r\nto put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: ‘I know no\r\nplace where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one\r\ndares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar,\r\nand not touch it until we are really in need of it.’ So the pot was\r\nplaced in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great\r\nyearning for it, and said to the mouse: ‘I want to tell you something,\r\nlittle mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has\r\nasked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold\r\nhim over the font at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look\r\nafter the house by yourself.’ ‘Yes, yes,’ answered the mouse, ‘by all\r\nmeans go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me. I\r\nshould like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.’ All this,\r\nhowever, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to\r\nbe godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat,\r\nbegan to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a\r\nwalk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then\r\nstretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought\r\nof the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home.\r\n‘Well, here you are again,’ said the mouse, ‘no doubt you have had a\r\nmerry day.’ ‘All went off well,’ answered the cat. ‘What name did they\r\ngive the child?’ ‘Top off!’ said the cat quite coolly. ‘Top off!’ cried\r\nthe mouse, ‘that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in\r\nyour family?’ ‘What does that matter,’ said the cat, ‘it is no worse\r\nthan Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.’\r\n\r\nBefore long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to\r\nthe mouse: ‘You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for\r\na day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a\r\nwhite ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.’ The good mouse consented,\r\nbut the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured\r\nhalf the pot of fat. ‘Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to\r\noneself,’ said she, and was quite satisfied with her day’s work. When\r\nshe went home the mouse inquired: ‘And what was the child christened?’\r\n‘Half-done,’ answered the cat. ‘Half-done! What are you saying? I\r\nnever heard the name in my life, I’ll wager anything it is not in the\r\ncalendar!’\r\n\r\nThe cat’s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. ‘All good\r\nthings go in threes,’ said she, ‘I am asked to stand godmother again.\r\nThe child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that\r\nexception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only\r\nhappens once every few years, you will let me go, won’t you?’ ‘Top-off!\r\nHalf-done!’ answered the mouse, ‘they are such odd names, they make me\r\nvery thoughtful.’ ‘You sit at home,’ said the cat, ‘in your dark-grey\r\nfur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that’s because\r\nyou do not go out in the daytime.’ During the cat’s absence the mouse\r\ncleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely\r\nemptied the pot of fat. ‘When everything is eaten up one has some\r\npeace,’ said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return\r\nhome till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to\r\nthe third child. ‘It will not please you more than the others,’ said the\r\ncat. ‘He is called All-gone.’ ‘All-gone,’ cried the mouse ‘that is the\r\nmost suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print. All-gone;\r\nwhat can that mean?’ and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay\r\ndown to sleep.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but\r\nwhen the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found\r\noutside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: ‘Come, cat,\r\nwe will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we\r\nshall enjoy that.’ ‘Yes,’ answered the cat, ‘you will enjoy it as much\r\nas you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the\r\nwindow.’ They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of\r\nfat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. ‘Alas!’ said the\r\nmouse, ‘now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true\r\nfriend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First\r\ntop off, then half-done, then--’ ‘Will you hold your tongue,’ cried the\r\ncat, ‘one word more, and I will eat you too.’ ‘All-gone’ was already on\r\nthe poor mouse’s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang\r\non her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOOSE-GIRL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of their\r\nonly child. This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and her\r\nmother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her. And there was a good\r\nfairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch\r\nover her. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a\r\ngreat way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she\r\ngot ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen her\r\nmother, packed up a great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and\r\nsilver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short everything that became a\r\nroyal bride. And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give\r\nher into the bridegroom’s hands; and each had a horse for the journey.\r\nNow the princess’s horse was the fairy’s gift, and it was called Falada,\r\nand could speak.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her\r\nbed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair,\r\nand gave it to the princess, and said, ‘Take care of it, dear child; for\r\nit is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.’ Then they all took\r\na sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into\r\nher bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her\r\nbridegroom’s kingdom.\r\n\r\nOne day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to\r\nfeel very thirsty: and she said to her maid, ‘Pray get down, and fetch\r\nme some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to\r\ndrink.’ ‘Nay,’ said the maid, ‘if you are thirsty, get off yourself, and\r\nstoop down by the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any\r\nlonger.’ Then she was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the\r\nlittle brook, and drank; for she was frightened, and dared not bring out\r\nher golden cup; and she wept and said, ‘Alas! what will become of me?’\r\nAnd the lock answered her, and said:\r\n\r\n ‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\r\n\r\nBut the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her\r\nmaid’s ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again.\r\n\r\nThen all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and\r\nthe sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again;\r\nand at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid’s rude\r\nspeech, and said, ‘Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in\r\nmy golden cup.’ But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily\r\nthan before: ‘Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.’\r\nThen the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay\r\ndown, and held her head over the running stream, and cried and said,\r\n‘What will become of me?’ And the lock of hair answered her again:\r\n\r\n ‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\r\n\r\nAnd as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom,\r\nand floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did\r\nnot see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the\r\ncharm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that\r\nshe had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and would\r\nhave got upon Falada again, the maid said, ‘I shall ride upon Falada,\r\nand you may have my horse instead’; so she was forced to give up her\r\nhorse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her\r\nmaid’s shabby ones.\r\n\r\nAt last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous\r\nservant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had\r\nhappened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well.\r\n\r\nThen the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon the\r\nother horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the\r\nroyal court. There was great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to\r\nmeet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one\r\nwho was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber;\r\nbut the true princess was told to stay in the court below.\r\n\r\nNow the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he\r\namused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was\r\ngoing on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty,\r\nand too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber\r\nto ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left\r\nstanding in the court below. ‘I brought her with me for the sake of her\r\ncompany on the road,’ said she; ‘pray give the girl some work to do,\r\nthat she may not be idle.’ The old king could not for some time think\r\nof any work for her to do; but at last he said, ‘I have a lad who takes\r\ncare of my geese; she may go and help him.’ Now the name of this lad,\r\nthat the real bride was to help in watching the king’s geese, was\r\nCurdken.\r\n\r\nBut the false bride said to the prince, ‘Dear husband, pray do me one\r\npiece of kindness.’ ‘That I will,’ said the prince. ‘Then tell one of\r\nyour slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it\r\nwas very unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road’; but the truth was,\r\nshe was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak, and\r\ntell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point, and the\r\nfaithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she\r\nwept, and begged the man to nail up Falada’s head against a large\r\ndark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning\r\nand evening, that there she might still see him sometimes. Then the\r\nslaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the head, and\r\nnailed it up under the dark gate.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate,\r\nshe said sorrowfully:\r\n\r\n ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’\r\n\r\nand the head answered:\r\n\r\n ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\r\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\r\n\r\nThen they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she\r\ncame to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her\r\nwaving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken\r\nsaw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of the\r\nlocks out, but she cried:\r\n\r\n ‘Blow, breezes, blow!\r\n  Let Curdken’s hat go!\r\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\r\n  Let him after it go!\r\n  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,\r\n  Away be it whirl’d\r\n  Till the silvery locks\r\n  Are all comb’d and curl’d!\r\n\r\nThen there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken’s hat; and\r\naway it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after\r\nit; till, by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her\r\nhair, and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky,\r\nand would not speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it\r\ngrew dark in the evening, and then drove them homewards.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor\r\ngirl looked up at Falada’s head, and cried:\r\n\r\n ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’\r\n\r\nand the head answered:\r\n\r\n ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\r\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\r\n\r\nThen she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and began\r\nto comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her, and wanted to\r\ntake hold of it; but she cried out quickly:\r\n\r\n ‘Blow, breezes, blow!\r\n  Let Curdken’s hat go!\r\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\r\n  Let him after it go!\r\n  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,\r\n  Away be it whirl’d\r\n  Till the silvery locks\r\n  Are all comb’d and curl’d!\r\n\r\nThen the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way,\r\nover the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when\r\nhe came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So they\r\nwatched the geese till it grew dark.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the old king, and\r\nsaid, ‘I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any\r\nlonger.’ ‘Why?’ said the king. ‘Because, instead of doing any good, she\r\ndoes nothing but tease me all day long.’ Then the king made him tell him\r\nwhat had happened. And Curdken said, ‘When we go in the morning through\r\nthe dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with the head\r\nof a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:\r\n\r\n ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’\r\n\r\nand the head answers:\r\n\r\n ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!\r\n  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,\r\n  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’\r\n\r\nAnd Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow\r\nwhere the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he was forced\r\nto run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But the\r\nold king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning\r\ncame, he placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how she spoke\r\nto Falada, and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field, and\r\nhid himself in a bush by the meadow’s side; and he soon saw with his own\r\neyes how they drove the flock of geese; and how, after a little time,\r\nshe let down her hair that glittered in the sun. And then he heard her\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n ‘Blow, breezes, blow!\r\n  Let Curdken’s hat go!\r\n  Blow, breezes, blow!\r\n  Let him after it go!\r\n  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,\r\n  Away be it whirl’d\r\n  Till the silvery locks\r\n  Are all comb’d and curl’d!\r\n\r\nAnd soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken’s hat, and away\r\nwent Curdken after it, while the girl went on combing and curling her\r\nhair. All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen; and\r\nwhen the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her aside,\r\nand asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and said, ‘That\r\nI must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.’\r\n\r\nBut the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had told\r\nhim all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it was very\r\nlucky for her that she did so, for when she had done the king ordered\r\nroyal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was\r\nso beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that he had only a\r\nfalse bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the true\r\nbride stood by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and\r\nheard how meek and patient she had been; and without saying anything to\r\nthe false bride, the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all\r\nhis court. The bridegroom sat at the top, with the false princess on one\r\nside, and the true one on the other; but nobody knew her again, for her\r\nbeauty was quite dazzling to their eyes; and she did not seem at all\r\nlike the little goose-girl, now that she had her brilliant dress on.\r\n\r\nWhen they had eaten and drank, and were very merry, the old king said\r\nhe would tell them a tale. So he began, and told all the story of the\r\nprincess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the\r\ntrue waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would\r\nbehave thus. ‘Nothing better,’ said this false bride, ‘than that she\r\nshould be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that\r\ntwo white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from street to\r\nstreet till she was dead.’ ‘Thou art she!’ said the old king; ‘and as\r\nthou has judged thyself, so shall it be done to thee.’ And the young\r\nking was then married to his true wife, and they reigned over the\r\nkingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good fairy came\r\nto see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ADVENTURES OF CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET\r\n\r\n\r\n1. HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS\r\n\r\n‘The nuts are quite ripe now,’ said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet,\r\n‘suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can,\r\nbefore the squirrel takes them all away.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said\r\nPartlet, ‘let us go and make a holiday of it together.’\r\n\r\nSo they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they stayed\r\nthere till the evening. Now, whether it was that they had eaten so many\r\nnuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and would not,\r\nI do not know: however, they took it into their heads that it did not\r\nbecome them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to build a little\r\ncarriage of nutshells: and when it was finished, Partlet jumped into\r\nit and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her\r\nhome. ‘That’s a good joke!’ said Chanticleer; ‘no, that will never do;\r\nI had rather by half walk home; I’ll sit on the box and be coachman,\r\nif you like, but I’ll not draw.’ While this was passing, a duck came\r\nquacking up and cried out, ‘You thieving vagabonds, what business have\r\nyou in my grounds? I’ll give it you well for your insolence!’ and upon\r\nthat she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily. But Chanticleer was no\r\ncoward, and returned the duck’s blows with his sharp spurs so fiercely\r\nthat she soon began to cry out for mercy; which was only granted her\r\nupon condition that she would draw the carriage home for them. This she\r\nagreed to do; and Chanticleer got upon the box, and drove, crying, ‘Now,\r\nduck, get on as fast as you can.’ And away they went at a pretty good\r\npace.\r\n\r\nAfter they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin\r\nwalking together along the road: and the needle cried out, ‘Stop, stop!’\r\nand said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such\r\ndirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his\r\nfriend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat\r\ndrinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore\r\nthat the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their\r\ncarriage. Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows, and not\r\nlikely to take up much room, told them they might ride, but made them\r\npromise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in, nor to\r\ntread on Partlet’s toes.\r\n\r\nLate at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in\r\nthe dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good\r\ndeal from one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their\r\nquarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his\r\nhouse was full, thinking they might not be very respectable company:\r\nhowever, they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet\r\nhad laid by the way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in\r\nthe habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in, and\r\nthey bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily.\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was\r\nstirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the\r\negg, they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into the\r\nfireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast asleep,\r\nand seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord’s easy chair\r\nand the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this, they crept\r\naway as softly as possible. However, the duck, who slept in the open\r\nair in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran\r\nclose by the inn, soon swam out of their reach.\r\n\r\nAn hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his handkerchief\r\nto wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked him: then he\r\nwalked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire, but when he\r\nstirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost blinded him.\r\n‘Bless me!’ said he, ‘all the world seems to have a design against my\r\nhead this morning’: and so saying, he threw himself sulkily into his\r\neasy chair; but, oh dear! the needle ran into him; and this time the\r\npain was not in his head. He now flew into a very great passion, and,\r\nsuspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look\r\nafter them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again\r\nwould take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no\r\nreckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VISIT MR KORBES\r\n\r\nAnother day, Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together;\r\nso Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and\r\nharnessed six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the carriage,\r\nand away they drove. Soon afterwards a cat met them, and said, ‘Where\r\nare you going?’ And Chanticleer replied,\r\n\r\n ‘All on our way\r\n  A visit to pay\r\n  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’\r\n\r\nThen the cat said, ‘Take me with you,’ Chanticleer said, ‘With all my\r\nheart: get up behind, and be sure you do not fall off.’\r\n\r\n ‘Take care of this handsome coach of mine,\r\n  Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine!\r\n  Now, mice, be ready,\r\n  And, wheels, run steady!\r\n  For we are going a visit to pay\r\n  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’\r\n\r\nSoon after came up a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin; and\r\nChanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at Mr Korbes’s house, he was not at home; so the mice\r\ndrew the carriage into the coach-house, Chanticleer and Partlet flew\r\nupon a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck got into\r\nthe washing cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow, the\r\nmillstone laid himself over the house door, and the egg rolled himself\r\nup in the towel.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr Korbes came home, he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but\r\nthe cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to\r\nwash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face; and\r\nwhen he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces in the towel all\r\nover his face and eyes. Then he was very angry, and went without his\r\nsupper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into\r\nhis cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have\r\nrun out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell\r\ndown on his head, and killed him on the spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF\r\n\r\nAnother day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountains\r\nto eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found\r\nshould be shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a very large\r\nnut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it all to\r\nherself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it\r\nstuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to\r\nChanticleer, ‘Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I\r\nshall be choked.’ Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river, and\r\nsaid, ‘River, give me some water, for Partlet lies in the mountain, and\r\nwill be choked by a great nut.’ The river said, ‘Run first to the bride,\r\nand ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water.’ Chanticleer ran to\r\nthe bride, and said, ‘Bride, you must give me a silken cord, for then\r\nthe river will give me water, and the water I will carry to Partlet, who\r\nlies on the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.’ But the bride\r\nsaid, ‘Run first, and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow\r\nin the garden.’ Then Chanticleer ran to the garden, and took the garland\r\nfrom the bough where it hung, and brought it to the bride; and then\r\nthe bride gave him the silken cord, and he took the silken cord to\r\nthe river, and the river gave him water, and he carried the water to\r\nPartlet; but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut, and lay\r\nquite dead, and never moved any more.\r\n\r\nThen Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts\r\ncame and wept with him over poor Partlet. And six mice built a little\r\nhearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed\r\nthemselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them. On the way they\r\nmet the fox. ‘Where are you going, Chanticleer?’ said he. ‘To bury my\r\nPartlet,’ said the other. ‘May I go with you?’ said the fox. ‘Yes; but\r\nyou must get up behind, or my horses will not be able to draw you.’ Then\r\nthe fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the bear, the goat, and\r\nall the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon the hearse.\r\n\r\nSo on they went till they came to a rapid stream. ‘How shall we get\r\nover?’ said Chanticleer. Then said a straw, ‘I will lay myself across,\r\nand you may pass over upon me.’ But as the mice were going over, the\r\nstraw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in\r\nand were drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood came\r\nand said, ‘I am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream, and you\r\nshall pass over upon me.’ So he laid himself down; but they managed\r\nso clumsily, that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the\r\nstream. Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly\r\noffered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream;\r\nand this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse, and\r\nmanaged to get Partlet out of it; but the fox and the other mourners,\r\nwho were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into the water\r\nand were all carried away by the stream and drowned.\r\n\r\nThus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having dug\r\na grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over her.\r\nThen he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he\r\ndied too; and so all were dead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAPUNZEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a\r\nchild. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.\r\nThese people had a little window at the back of their house from which\r\na splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful\r\nflowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no\r\none dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had\r\ngreat power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was\r\nstanding by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a\r\nbed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it\r\nlooked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away,\r\nand began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and\r\nasked: ‘What ails you, dear wife?’ ‘Ah,’ she replied, ‘if I can’t eat\r\nsome of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall\r\ndie.’ The man, who loved her, thought: ‘Sooner than let your wife die,\r\nbring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.’\r\nAt twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the\r\nenchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his\r\nwife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. It\r\ntasted so good to her--so very good, that the next day she longed for it\r\nthree times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband\r\nmust once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening\r\ntherefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the\r\nwall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before\r\nhim. ‘How can you dare,’ said she with angry look, ‘descend into my\r\ngarden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!’\r\n‘Ah,’ answered he, ‘let mercy take the place of justice, I only made\r\nup my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the\r\nwindow, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she\r\nhad not got some to eat.’ Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be\r\nsoftened, and said to him: ‘If the case be as you say, I will allow\r\nyou to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one\r\ncondition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into\r\nthe world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a\r\nmother.’ The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the\r\nwoman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the\r\nchild the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.\r\n\r\nRapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was\r\ntwelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in\r\na forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a\r\nlittle window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself\r\nbeneath it and cried:\r\n\r\n ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r\n  Let down your hair to me.’\r\n\r\nRapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she\r\nheard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses,\r\nwound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair\r\nfell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.\r\n\r\nAfter a year or two, it came to pass that the king’s son rode through\r\nthe forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so\r\ncharming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her\r\nsolitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The king’s\r\nson wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower,\r\nbut none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply\r\ntouched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and\r\nlistened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw\r\nthat an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried:\r\n\r\n ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r\n  Let down your hair to me.’\r\n\r\nThen Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress\r\nclimbed up to her. ‘If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too\r\nwill try my fortune,’ said he, and the next day when it began to grow\r\ndark, he went to the tower and cried:\r\n\r\n ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r\n  Let down your hair to me.’\r\n\r\nImmediately the hair fell down and the king’s son climbed up.\r\n\r\nAt first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes\r\nhad never yet beheld, came to her; but the king’s son began to talk to\r\nher quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred\r\nthat it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her.\r\nThen Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take\r\nhim for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she\r\nthought: ‘He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does’; and she said\r\nyes, and laid her hand in his. She said: ‘I will willingly go away with\r\nyou, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk\r\nevery time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when\r\nthat is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.’ They\r\nagreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the\r\nold woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until\r\nonce Rapunzel said to her: ‘Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that\r\nyou are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young king’s son--he\r\nis with me in a moment.’ ‘Ah! you wicked child,’ cried the enchantress.\r\n‘What do I hear you say! I thought I had separated you from all\r\nthe world, and yet you have deceived me!’ In her anger she clutched\r\nRapunzel’s beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand,\r\nseized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut\r\noff, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless\r\nthat she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great\r\ngrief and misery.\r\n\r\nOn the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress\r\nfastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the\r\nwindow, and when the king’s son came and cried:\r\n\r\n ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,\r\n  Let down your hair to me.’\r\n\r\nshe let the hair down. The king’s son ascended, but instead of finding\r\nhis dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with\r\nwicked and venomous looks. ‘Aha!’ she cried mockingly, ‘you would fetch\r\nyour dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest;\r\nthe cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is\r\nlost to you; you will never see her again.’ The king’s son was beside\r\nhimself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He\r\nescaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his\r\neyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but\r\nroots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of\r\nhis dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at\r\nlength came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she\r\nhad given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a\r\nvoice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and\r\nwhen he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two\r\nof her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could\r\nsee with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was\r\njoyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and\r\ncontented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNDEVOGEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as\r\nhe entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were\r\nthere. He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree, and at\r\nthe top of this a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallen\r\nasleep under the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen it in\r\nher arms, had flown down, snatched it away, and set it on the high tree.\r\n\r\nThe forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to himself:\r\n‘You will take him home with you, and bring him up with your Lina.’ He\r\ntook it home, therefore, and the two children grew up together. And the\r\none, which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel, because a bird\r\nhad carried it away. Fundevogel and Lina loved each other so dearly that\r\nwhen they did not see each other they were sad.\r\n\r\nNow the forester had an old cook, who one evening took two pails and\r\nbegan to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out\r\nto the spring. Lina saw this and said, ‘Listen, old Sanna, why are you\r\nfetching so much water?’ ‘If you will never repeat it to anyone, I will\r\ntell you why.’ So Lina said, no, she would never repeat it to anyone,\r\nand then the cook said: ‘Early tomorrow morning, when the forester\r\nis out hunting, I will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the\r\nkettle, I will throw in Fundevogel, and will boil him in it.’\r\n\r\nEarly next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and when he\r\nwas gone the children were still in bed. Then Lina said to Fundevogel:\r\n‘If you will never leave me, I too will never leave you.’ Fundevogel\r\nsaid: ‘Neither now, nor ever will I leave you.’ Then said Lina: ‘Then\r\nwill I tell you. Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water\r\ninto the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said\r\nthat if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early\r\ntomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle\r\nfull of water, throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up\r\nquickly, dress ourselves, and go away together.’\r\n\r\nThe two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly, and went\r\naway. When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the\r\nbedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it. But when she came in,\r\nand went to the beds, both the children were gone. Then she was terribly\r\nalarmed, and she said to herself: ‘What shall I say now when the\r\nforester comes home and sees that the children are gone? They must be\r\nfollowed instantly to get them back again.’\r\n\r\nThen the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and\r\novertake the children. The children, however, were sitting outside the\r\nforest, and when they saw from afar the three servants running, Lina\r\nsaid to Fundevogel: ‘Never leave me, and I will never leave you.’\r\nFundevogel said: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’ Then said Lina: ‘Do you become\r\na rose-tree, and I the rose upon it.’ When the three servants came to\r\nthe forest, nothing was there but a rose-tree and one rose on it, but\r\nthe children were nowhere. Then said they: ‘There is nothing to be done\r\nhere,’ and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing\r\nin the forest but a little rose-bush with one rose on it. Then the\r\nold cook scolded and said: ‘You simpletons, you should have cut the\r\nrose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and brought it home with\r\nyou; go, and do it at once.’ They had therefore to go out and look for\r\nthe second time. The children, however, saw them coming from a distance.\r\nThen Lina said: ‘Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never leave\r\nyou.’ Fundevogel said: ‘Neither now; nor ever.’ Said Lina: ‘Then do you\r\nbecome a church, and I’ll be the chandelier in it.’ So when the three\r\nservants came, nothing was there but a church, with a chandelier in\r\nit. They said therefore to each other: ‘What can we do here, let us go\r\nhome.’ When they got home, the cook asked if they had not found them;\r\nso they said no, they had found nothing but a church, and there was a\r\nchandelier in it. And the cook scolded them and said: ‘You fools! why\r\ndid you not pull the church to pieces, and bring the chandelier home\r\nwith you?’ And now the old cook herself got on her legs, and went with\r\nthe three servants in pursuit of the children. The children, however,\r\nsaw from afar that the three servants were coming, and the cook waddling\r\nafter them. Then said Lina: ‘Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will\r\nnever leave you.’ Then said Fundevogel: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’\r\nSaid Lina: ‘Be a fishpond, and I will be the duck upon it.’ The cook,\r\nhowever, came up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay down by it,\r\nand was about to drink it up. But the duck swam quickly to her, seized\r\nher head in its beak and drew her into the water, and there the old\r\nwitch had to drown. Then the children went home together, and were\r\nheartily delighted, and if they have not died, they are living still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VALIANT LITTLE TAILOR\r\n\r\n\r\nOne summer’s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the\r\nwindow; he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might. Then came\r\na peasant woman down the street crying: ‘Good jams, cheap! Good jams,\r\ncheap!’ This rang pleasantly in the tailor’s ears; he stretched his\r\ndelicate head out of the window, and called: ‘Come up here, dear woman;\r\nhere you will get rid of your goods.’ The woman came up the three steps\r\nto the tailor with her heavy basket, and he made her unpack all the pots\r\nfor him. He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and\r\nat length said: ‘The jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four\r\nounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no\r\nconsequence.’ The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him\r\nwhat he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling. ‘Now, this jam\r\nshall be blessed by God,’ cried the little tailor, ‘and give me health\r\nand strength’; so he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself\r\na piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it. ‘This won’t\r\ntaste bitter,’ said he, ‘but I will just finish the jacket before I\r\ntake a bite.’ He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made\r\nbigger and bigger stitches. In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam\r\nrose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were\r\nattracted and descended on it in hosts. ‘Hi! who invited you?’ said the\r\nlittle tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away. The flies, however,\r\nwho understood no German, would not be turned away, but came back\r\nagain in ever-increasing companies. The little tailor at last lost all\r\npatience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table,\r\nand saying: ‘Wait, and I will give it to you,’ struck it mercilessly on\r\nthem. When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer\r\nthan seven, dead and with legs stretched out. ‘Are you a fellow of that\r\nsort?’ said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery. ‘The whole\r\ntown shall know of this!’ And the little tailor hastened to cut himself\r\na girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters: ‘Seven at\r\none stroke!’ ‘What, the town!’ he continued, ‘the whole world shall hear\r\nof it!’ and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb’s tail. The tailor\r\nput on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he\r\nthought his workshop was too small for his valour. Before he went away,\r\nhe sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could\r\ntake with him; however, he found nothing but an old cheese, and that\r\nhe put in his pocket. In front of the door he observed a bird which\r\nhad caught itself in the thicket. It had to go into his pocket with the\r\ncheese. Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble,\r\nhe felt no fatigue. The road led him up a mountain, and when he had\r\nreached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking\r\npeacefully about him. The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to him,\r\nand said: ‘Good day, comrade, so you are sitting there overlooking the\r\nwide-spread world! I am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck.\r\nHave you any inclination to go with me?’ The giant looked contemptuously\r\nat the tailor, and said: ‘You ragamuffin! You miserable creature!’\r\n\r\n‘Oh, indeed?’ answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and\r\nshowed the giant the girdle, ‘there may you read what kind of a man I\r\nam!’ The giant read: ‘Seven at one stroke,’ and thought that they had\r\nbeen men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect\r\nfor the tiny fellow. Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took\r\na stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out\r\nof it. ‘Do that likewise,’ said the giant, ‘if you have strength.’ ‘Is\r\nthat all?’ said the tailor, ‘that is child’s play with us!’ and put his\r\nhand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until\r\nthe liquid ran out of it. ‘Faith,’ said he, ‘that was a little better,\r\nwasn’t it?’ The giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it\r\nof the little man. Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high\r\nthat the eye could scarcely follow it. ‘Now, little mite of a man, do\r\nthat likewise,’ ‘Well thrown,’ said the tailor, ‘but after all the stone\r\ncame down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come\r\nback at all,’ and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird,\r\nand threw it into the air. The bird, delighted with its liberty,\r\nrose, flew away and did not come back. ‘How does that shot please you,\r\ncomrade?’ asked the tailor. ‘You can certainly throw,’ said the giant,\r\n‘but now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly.’ He\r\ntook the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on\r\nthe ground, and said: ‘If you are strong enough, help me to carry the\r\ntree out of the forest.’ ‘Readily,’ answered the little man; ‘take you\r\nthe trunk on your shoulders, and I will raise up the branches and twigs;\r\nafter all, they are the heaviest.’ The giant took the trunk on his\r\nshoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who\r\ncould not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little\r\ntailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and\r\nwhistled the song: ‘Three tailors rode forth from the gate,’ as if\r\ncarrying the tree were child’s play. The giant, after he had dragged the\r\nheavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried: ‘Hark\r\nyou, I shall have to let the tree fall!’ The tailor sprang nimbly down,\r\nseized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and said\r\nto the giant: ‘You are such a great fellow, and yet cannot even carry\r\nthe tree!’\r\n\r\nThey went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid\r\nhold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it\r\ndown, gave it into the tailor’s hand, and bade him eat. But the little\r\ntailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go,\r\nit sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it.\r\nWhen he had fallen down again without injury, the giant said: ‘What is\r\nthis? Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?’ ‘There is no\r\nlack of strength,’ answered the little tailor. ‘Do you think that could\r\nbe anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow? I leapt over\r\nthe tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket.\r\nJump as I did, if you can do it.’ The giant made the attempt but he\r\ncould not get over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so\r\nthat in this also the tailor kept the upper hand.\r\n\r\nThe giant said: ‘If you are such a valiant fellow, come with me into our\r\ncavern and spend the night with us.’ The little tailor was willing, and\r\nfollowed him. When they went into the cave, other giants were sitting\r\nthere by the fire, and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand and\r\nwas eating it. The little tailor looked round and thought: ‘It is much\r\nmore spacious here than in my workshop.’ The giant showed him a bed, and\r\nsaid he was to lie down in it and sleep. The bed, however, was too\r\nbig for the little tailor; he did not lie down in it, but crept into\r\na corner. When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the little\r\ntailor was lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar,\r\ncut through the bed with one blow, and thought he had finished off the\r\ngrasshopper for good. With the earliest dawn the giants went into the\r\nforest, and had quite forgotten the little tailor, when all at once he\r\nwalked up to them quite merrily and boldly. The giants were terrified,\r\nthey were afraid that he would strike them all dead, and ran away in a\r\ngreat hurry.\r\n\r\nThe little tailor went onwards, always following his own pointed nose.\r\nAfter he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard of a royal\r\npalace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and fell asleep.\r\nWhilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all sides, and\r\nread on his girdle: ‘Seven at one stroke.’ ‘Ah!’ said they, ‘what does\r\nthe great warrior want here in the midst of peace? He must be a mighty\r\nlord.’ They went and announced him to the king, and gave it as their\r\nopinion that if war should break out, this would be a weighty and useful\r\nman who ought on no account to be allowed to depart. The counsel pleased\r\nthe king, and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer\r\nhim military service when he awoke. The ambassador remained standing by\r\nthe sleeper, waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes,\r\nand then conveyed to him this proposal. ‘For this very reason have\r\nI come here,’ the tailor replied, ‘I am ready to enter the king’s\r\nservice.’ He was therefore honourably received, and a special dwelling\r\nwas assigned him.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and wished\r\nhim a thousand miles away. ‘What is to be the end of this?’ they said\r\namong themselves. ‘If we quarrel with him, and he strikes about him,\r\nseven of us will fall at every blow; not one of us can stand against\r\nhim.’ They came therefore to a decision, betook themselves in a body to\r\nthe king, and begged for their dismissal. ‘We are not prepared,’ said\r\nthey, ‘to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke.’ The king was\r\nsorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants,\r\nwished that he had never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly\r\nhave been rid of him again. But he did not venture to give him his\r\ndismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people\r\ndead, and place himself on the royal throne. He thought about it for a\r\nlong time, and at last found good counsel. He sent to the little tailor\r\nand caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior, he had one\r\nrequest to make to him. In a forest of his country lived two giants,\r\nwho caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging,\r\nand burning, and no one could approach them without putting himself in\r\ndanger of death. If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants, he\r\nwould give him his only daughter to wife, and half of his kingdom as a\r\ndowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him.\r\n‘That would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me!’ thought the\r\nlittle tailor. ‘One is not offered a beautiful princess and half a\r\nkingdom every day of one’s life!’ ‘Oh, yes,’ he replied, ‘I will soon\r\nsubdue the giants, and do not require the help of the hundred horsemen\r\nto do it; he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of\r\ntwo.’\r\n\r\nThe little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed him.\r\nWhen he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his followers:\r\n‘Just stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the giants.’ Then\r\nhe bounded into the forest and looked about right and left. After a\r\nwhile he perceived both giants. They lay sleeping under a tree, and\r\nsnored so that the branches waved up and down. The little tailor, not\r\nidle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the\r\ntree. When he was halfway up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat\r\njust above the sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on\r\nthe breast of one of the giants. For a long time the giant felt nothing,\r\nbut at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said: ‘Why are you\r\nknocking me?’ ‘You must be dreaming,’ said the other, ‘I am not knocking\r\nyou.’ They laid themselves down to sleep again, and then the tailor\r\nthrew a stone down on the second. ‘What is the meaning of this?’ cried\r\nthe other ‘Why are you pelting me?’ ‘I am not pelting you,’ answered\r\nthe first, growling. They disputed about it for a time, but as they were\r\nweary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed once more. The\r\nlittle tailor began his game again, picked out the biggest stone, and\r\nthrew it with all his might on the breast of the first giant. ‘That\r\nis too bad!’ cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his\r\ncompanion against the tree until it shook. The other paid him back in\r\nthe same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and\r\nbelaboured each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on\r\nthe ground at the same time. Then the little tailor leapt down. ‘It is\r\na lucky thing,’ said he, ‘that they did not tear up the tree on which\r\nI was sitting, or I should have had to sprint on to another like a\r\nsquirrel; but we tailors are nimble.’ He drew out his sword and gave\r\neach of them a couple of thrusts in the breast, and then went out to the\r\nhorsemen and said: ‘The work is done; I have finished both of them\r\noff, but it was hard work! They tore up trees in their sore need, and\r\ndefended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man\r\nlike myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.’ ‘But are you not\r\nwounded?’ asked the horsemen. ‘You need not concern yourself about\r\nthat,’ answered the tailor, ‘they have not bent one hair of mine.’ The\r\nhorsemen would not believe him, and rode into the forest; there they\r\nfound the giants swimming in their blood, and all round about lay the\r\ntorn-up trees.\r\n\r\nThe little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; he, however,\r\nrepented of his promise, and again bethought himself how he could get\r\nrid of the hero. ‘Before you receive my daughter, and the half of my\r\nkingdom,’ said he to him, ‘you must perform one more heroic deed. In\r\nthe forest roams a unicorn which does great harm, and you must catch\r\nit first.’ ‘I fear one unicorn still less than two giants. Seven at one\r\nblow, is my kind of affair.’ He took a rope and an axe with him, went\r\nforth into the forest, and again bade those who were sent with him to\r\nwait outside. He had not long to seek. The unicorn soon came towards\r\nhim, and rushed directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its\r\nhorn without more ado. ‘Softly, softly; it can’t be done as quickly as\r\nthat,’ said he, and stood still and waited until the animal was quite\r\nclose, and then sprang nimbly behind the tree. The unicorn ran against\r\nthe tree with all its strength, and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk\r\nthat it had not the strength enough to draw it out again, and thus it\r\nwas caught. ‘Now, I have got the bird,’ said the tailor, and came out\r\nfrom behind the tree and put the rope round its neck, and then with his\r\naxe he hewed the horn out of the tree, and when all was ready he led the\r\nbeast away and took it to the king.\r\n\r\nThe king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third\r\ndemand. Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that\r\nmade great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give him their\r\nhelp. ‘Willingly,’ said the tailor, ‘that is child’s play!’ He did not\r\ntake the huntsmen with him into the forest, and they were well pleased\r\nthat he did not, for the wild boar had several times received them in\r\nsuch a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him. When\r\nthe boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and\r\nwhetted tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the hero\r\nfled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at\r\nonce, and in one bound out again. The boar ran after him, but the tailor\r\nran round outside and shut the door behind it, and then the raging\r\nbeast, which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window,\r\nwas caught. The little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they\r\nmight see the prisoner with their own eyes. The hero, however, went to\r\nthe king, who was now, whether he liked it or not, obliged to keep his\r\npromise, and gave his daughter and the half of his kingdom. Had he known\r\nthat it was no warlike hero, but a little tailor who was standing before\r\nhim, it would have gone to his heart still more than it did. The wedding\r\nwas held with great magnificence and small joy, and out of a tailor a\r\nking was made.\r\n\r\nAfter some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at\r\nnight: ‘Boy, make me the doublet, and patch the pantaloons, or else I\r\nwill rap the yard-measure over your ears.’ Then she discovered in what\r\nstate of life the young lord had been born, and next morning complained\r\nof her wrongs to her father, and begged him to help her to get rid of\r\nher husband, who was nothing else but a tailor. The king comforted her\r\nand said: ‘Leave your bedroom door open this night, and my servants\r\nshall stand outside, and when he has fallen asleep shall go in, bind\r\nhim, and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wide\r\nworld.’ The woman was satisfied with this; but the king’s armour-bearer,\r\nwho had heard all, was friendly with the young lord, and informed him of\r\nthe whole plot. ‘I’ll put a screw into that business,’ said the little\r\ntailor. At night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time, and\r\nwhen she thought that he had fallen asleep, she got up, opened the door,\r\nand then lay down again. The little tailor, who was only pretending to\r\nbe asleep, began to cry out in a clear voice: ‘Boy, make me the doublet\r\nand patch me the pantaloons, or I will rap the yard-measure over your\r\nears. I smote seven at one blow. I killed two giants, I brought away one\r\nunicorn, and caught a wild boar, and am I to fear those who are standing\r\noutside the room.’ When these men heard the tailor speaking thus, they\r\nwere overcome by a great dread, and ran as if the wild huntsman were\r\nbehind them, and none of them would venture anything further against\r\nhim. So the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHANSEL AND GRETEL\r\n\r\n\r\nHard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his\r\ntwo children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had\r\nlittle to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the\r\nland, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought\r\nover this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he\r\ngroaned and said to his wife: ‘What is to become of us? How are we\r\nto feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for\r\nourselves?’ ‘I’ll tell you what, husband,’ answered the woman, ‘early\r\ntomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where\r\nit is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each\r\nof them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and\r\nleave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be\r\nrid of them.’ ‘No, wife,’ said the man, ‘I will not do that; how can I\r\nbear to leave my children alone in the forest?--the wild animals would\r\nsoon come and tear them to pieces.’ ‘O, you fool!’ said she, ‘then we\r\nmust all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our\r\ncoffins,’ and she left him no peace until he consented. ‘But I feel very\r\nsorry for the poor children, all the same,’ said the man.\r\n\r\nThe two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had\r\nheard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept\r\nbitter tears, and said to Hansel: ‘Now all is over with us.’ ‘Be quiet,\r\nGretel,’ said Hansel, ‘do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way\r\nto help us.’ And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put\r\non his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon\r\nshone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house\r\nglittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the\r\nlittle pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went\r\nback and said to Gretel: ‘Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in\r\npeace, God will not forsake us,’ and he lay down again in his bed. When\r\nday dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the\r\ntwo children, saying: ‘Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the\r\nforest to fetch wood.’ She gave each a little piece of bread, and said:\r\n‘There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then,\r\nfor you will get nothing else.’ Gretel took the bread under her apron,\r\nas Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together\r\non the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel\r\nstood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again.\r\nHis father said: ‘Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying\r\nbehind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.’ ‘Ah,\r\nfather,’ said Hansel, ‘I am looking at my little white cat, which is\r\nsitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.’ The wife said:\r\n‘Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is\r\nshining on the chimneys.’ Hansel, however, had not been looking back at\r\nthe cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones\r\nout of his pocket on the road.\r\n\r\nWhen they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: ‘Now,\r\nchildren, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not\r\nbe cold.’ Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a\r\nlittle hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning\r\nvery high, the woman said: ‘Now, children, lay yourselves down by the\r\nfire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we\r\nhave done, we will come back and fetch you away.’\r\n\r\nHansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little\r\npiece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they\r\nbelieved that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but\r\na branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was\r\nblowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long\r\ntime, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When\r\nat last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and\r\nsaid: ‘How are we to get out of the forest now?’ But Hansel comforted\r\nher and said: ‘Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we\r\nwill soon find the way.’ And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took\r\nhis little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like\r\nnewly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.\r\n\r\nThey walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more\r\nto their father’s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman\r\nopened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: ‘You naughty\r\nchildren, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought you were\r\nnever coming back at all!’ The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut\r\nhim to the heart to leave them behind alone.\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the\r\nland, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their\r\nfather: ‘Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that\r\nis the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the\r\nwood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other\r\nmeans of saving ourselves!’ The man’s heart was heavy, and he thought:\r\n‘It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your\r\nchildren.’ The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to\r\nsay, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise,\r\nand as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nThe children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation.\r\nWhen the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go\r\nout and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked\r\nthe door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his\r\nlittle sister, and said: ‘Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the\r\ngood God will help us.’\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their\r\nbeds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller\r\nthan the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his\r\nin his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.\r\n‘Hansel, why do you stop and look round?’ said the father, ‘go on.’ ‘I\r\nam looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and\r\nwants to say goodbye to me,’ answered Hansel. ‘Fool!’ said the woman,\r\n‘that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining\r\non the chimney.’ Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs\r\non the path.\r\n\r\nThe woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had\r\nnever in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and\r\nthe mother said: ‘Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired\r\nyou may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in\r\nthe evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.’ When\r\nit was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had\r\nscattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but\r\nno one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark\r\nnight, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: ‘Just wait,\r\nGretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread\r\nwhich I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.’ When\r\nthe moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many\r\nthousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked\r\nthem all up. Hansel said to Gretel: ‘We shall soon find the way,’ but\r\nthey did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day\r\ntoo from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest,\r\nand were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three\r\nberries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their\r\nlegs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nIt was now three mornings since they had left their father’s house. They\r\nbegan to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if\r\nhelp did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it\r\nwas mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough,\r\nwhich sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And\r\nwhen its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them,\r\nand they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of\r\nwhich it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw\r\nthat it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows\r\nwere of clear sugar. ‘We will set to work on that,’ said Hansel, ‘and\r\nhave a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat\r\nsome of the window, it will taste sweet.’ Hansel reached up above, and\r\nbroke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant\r\nagainst the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried\r\nfrom the parlour:\r\n\r\n ‘Nibble, nibble, gnaw,\r\n  Who is nibbling at my little house?’\r\n\r\nThe children answered:\r\n\r\n ‘The wind, the wind,\r\n  The heaven-born wind,’\r\n\r\nand went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the\r\ntaste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out\r\nthe whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with\r\nit. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who\r\nsupported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were\r\nso terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their\r\nhands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: ‘Oh, you dear\r\nchildren, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No\r\nharm shall happen to you.’ She took them both by the hand, and led them\r\ninto her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and\r\npancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little\r\nbeds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down\r\nin them, and thought they were in heaven.\r\n\r\nThe old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality\r\na wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the\r\nlittle house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell\r\ninto her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast\r\nday with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have\r\na keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near.\r\nWhen Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with\r\nmalice, and said mockingly: ‘I have them, they shall not escape me\r\nagain!’ Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was\r\nalready up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so\r\npretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: ‘That\r\nwill be a dainty mouthful!’ Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled\r\nhand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a\r\ngrated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to\r\nGretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: ‘Get up, lazy thing, fetch\r\nsome water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the\r\nstable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.’\r\nGretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was\r\nforced to do what the wicked witch commanded.\r\n\r\nAnd now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing\r\nbut crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and\r\ncried: ‘Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon\r\nbe fat.’ Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and\r\nthe old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was\r\nHansel’s finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening\r\nhim. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she\r\nwas seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. ‘Now, then,\r\nGretel,’ she cried to the girl, ‘stir yourself, and bring some water.\r\nLet Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.’ Ah,\r\nhow the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water,\r\nand how her tears did flow down her cheeks! ‘Dear God, do help us,’ she\r\ncried. ‘If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should\r\nat any rate have died together.’ ‘Just keep your noise to yourself,’\r\nsaid the old woman, ‘it won’t help you at all.’\r\n\r\nEarly in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with\r\nthe water, and light the fire. ‘We will bake first,’ said the old woman,\r\n‘I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.’ She pushed poor\r\nGretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting.\r\n‘Creep in,’ said the witch, ‘and see if it is properly heated, so that\r\nwe can put the bread in.’ And once Gretel was inside, she intended to\r\nshut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.\r\nBut Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: ‘I do not know how I am\r\nto do it; how do I get in?’ ‘Silly goose,’ said the old woman. ‘The door\r\nis big enough; just look, I can get in myself!’ and she crept up and\r\nthrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove\r\nher far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then\r\nshe began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless\r\nwitch was miserably burnt to death.\r\n\r\nGretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable,\r\nand cried: ‘Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!’ Then Hansel\r\nsprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did\r\nrejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And\r\nas they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch’s\r\nhouse, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.\r\n‘These are far better than pebbles!’ said Hansel, and thrust into his\r\npockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said: ‘I, too, will take\r\nsomething home with me,’ and filled her pinafore full. ‘But now we must\r\nbe off,’ said Hansel, ‘that we may get out of the witch’s forest.’\r\n\r\nWhen they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of\r\nwater. ‘We cannot cross,’ said Hansel, ‘I see no foot-plank, and no\r\nbridge.’ ‘And there is also no ferry,’ answered Gretel, ‘but a white\r\nduck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.’ Then she\r\ncried:\r\n\r\n ‘Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,\r\n  Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?\r\n  There’s never a plank, or bridge in sight,\r\n  Take us across on thy back so white.’\r\n\r\nThe duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told\r\nhis sister to sit by him. ‘No,’ replied Gretel, ‘that will be too heavy\r\nfor the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.’ The\r\ngood little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had\r\nwalked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar\r\nto them, and at length they saw from afar their father’s house. Then\r\nthey began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round\r\ntheir father’s neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had\r\nleft the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel\r\nemptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the\r\nroom, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to\r\nadd to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together\r\nin perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever\r\ncatches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOUSE, THE BIRD, AND THE SAUSAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into\r\npartnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;\r\nthey lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add\r\nconsiderably to their stores. The bird’s duty was to fly daily into the\r\nwood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw\r\nto the cooking.\r\n\r\nWhen people are too well off they always begin to long for something\r\nnew. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a\r\nfellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his\r\nhousehold arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a\r\npoor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed\r\nat home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire\r\nand fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest\r\nuntil it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the\r\npot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near\r\ndinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out\r\namong the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered,\r\nand salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and\r\nhad laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had\r\nfinished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following\r\nmorning: and that was really a very delightful life.\r\n\r\nInfluenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in\r\nthe wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough,\r\nand had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a\r\nchange, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray\r\nas the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained\r\nmaster of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore\r\ndrew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse\r\nto cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.\r\n\r\nAnd now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird\r\nmade the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited\r\ntill the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the\r\nsausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird\r\nflew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across\r\na dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate\r\nbooty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog\r\nof this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for\r\nthe dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and\r\nthat was the reason his life had been forfeited.\r\n\r\nHe picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he\r\nhad seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the\r\nbest of things and to remain with one another.\r\n\r\nSo now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and,\r\nwishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and\r\nout among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the\r\npot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having\r\nalready parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.\r\n\r\nPresently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he\r\ncould nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood\r\nhere and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to\r\nbe found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down,\r\ncaught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water,\r\nbut his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable\r\nto recover himself, he was drowned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTHER HOLLE\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them\r\nwas beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The mother,\r\nhowever, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own\r\ndaughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made\r\nto do all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the\r\nfamily. Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well in\r\nthe high road, there to spin until she made her fingers bleed. Now it\r\nchanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the girl\r\nstopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang out\r\nof her hand and fell into the well. She ran home crying to tell of her\r\nmisfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to her, and after giving\r\nher a violent scolding, said unkindly, ‘As you have let the spindle fall\r\ninto the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.’\r\n\r\nThe girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last in\r\nher distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.\r\n\r\nShe remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a\r\nbeautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers blooming\r\nin every direction.\r\n\r\nShe walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker’s oven\r\nfull of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, ‘Take us out, take us\r\nout, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long\r\nago.’ So she took the bread-shovel and drew them all out.\r\n\r\nShe went on a little farther, till she came to a tree full of apples.\r\n‘Shake me, shake me, I pray,’ cried the tree; ‘my apples, one and all,\r\nare ripe.’ So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down upon\r\nher like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a single\r\napple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a\r\nheap and walked on again.\r\n\r\nThe next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old\r\nwoman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and\r\nturned to run away. But the old woman called after her, ‘What are you\r\nafraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do the work of my house\r\nproperly for me, I will make you very happy. You must be very careful,\r\nhowever, to make my bed in the right way, for I wish you always to shake\r\nit thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then they say, down there\r\nin the world, that it is snowing; for I am Mother Holle.’ The old woman\r\nspoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter\r\ninto her service.\r\n\r\nShe took care to do everything according to the old woman’s bidding and\r\nevery time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so that the\r\nfeathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman was as good\r\nas her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her roast and\r\nboiled meats every day.\r\n\r\nSo she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began\r\nto grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she\r\nbecame conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she\r\nwas homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother\r\nHolle than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile, she went\r\nto Mother Holle and said, ‘I am so homesick, that I cannot stay with\r\nyou any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own\r\npeople.’\r\n\r\nThen Mother Holle said, ‘I am pleased that you should want to go back\r\nto your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I\r\nwill take you home myself.’\r\n\r\nThereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gate\r\nwas opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold fell upon\r\nher, and the gold clung to her, so that she was covered with it from\r\nhead to foot.\r\n\r\n‘That is a reward for your industry,’ said Mother Holle, and as she\r\nspoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.\r\n\r\nThe gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old\r\nworld close to her mother’s house. As she entered the courtyard, the\r\ncock who was perched on the well, called out:\r\n\r\n ‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!\r\n  Your golden daughter’s come back to you.’\r\n\r\nThen she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly\r\ncovered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them\r\nall that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her\r\ngreat riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go\r\nand try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the well\r\nand spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a\r\nthorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then\r\nshe threw it into the well, and jumped in herself.\r\n\r\nLike her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it\r\ntill she came to the oven. ‘Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall\r\nbe burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,’ cried the loaves\r\nas before. But the lazy girl answered, ‘Do you think I am going to dirty\r\nmy hands for you?’ and walked on.\r\n\r\nPresently she came to the apple-tree. ‘Shake me, shake me, I pray; my\r\napples, one and all, are ripe,’ it cried. But she only answered, ‘A nice\r\nthing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,’ and\r\npassed on.\r\n\r\nAt last she came to Mother Holle’s house, and as she had heard all about\r\nthe large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged\r\nherself without delay to the old woman.\r\n\r\nThe first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself\r\nto please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in\r\nreturn. The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and\r\nthe third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in\r\nthe mornings and refused to get up. Worse still, she neglected to\r\nmake the old woman’s bed properly, and forgot to shake it so that the\r\nfeathers might fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her,\r\nand told her she might go. The lazy girl was delighted at this, and\r\nthought to herself, ‘The gold will soon be mine.’ Mother Holle led her,\r\nas she had led her sister, to the broad gateway; but as she was passing\r\nthrough, instead of the shower of gold, a great bucketful of pitch came\r\npouring over her.\r\n\r\n‘That is in return for your services,’ said the old woman, and she shut\r\nthe gate.\r\n\r\nSo the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock on the\r\nwell called out as she saw her:\r\n\r\n ‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!\r\n  Your dirty daughter’s come back to you.’\r\n\r\nBut, try what she would, she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to\r\nher as long as she lived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE RED-CAP [LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone\r\nwho looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was\r\nnothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a\r\nlittle cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never\r\nwear anything else; so she was always called ‘Little Red-Cap.’\r\n\r\nOne day her mother said to her: ‘Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece\r\nof cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill\r\nand weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and\r\nwhen you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path,\r\nor you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will\r\nget nothing; and when you go into her room, don’t forget to say, “Good\r\nmorning”, and don’t peep into every corner before you do it.’\r\n\r\n‘I will take great care,’ said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave\r\nher hand on it.\r\n\r\nThe grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village,\r\nand just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap\r\ndid not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n‘Good day, Little Red-Cap,’ said he.\r\n\r\n‘Thank you kindly, wolf.’\r\n\r\n‘Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?’\r\n\r\n‘To my grandmother’s.’\r\n\r\n‘What have you got in your apron?’\r\n\r\n‘Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to\r\nhave something good, to make her stronger.’\r\n\r\n‘Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?’\r\n\r\n‘A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands\r\nunder the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you\r\nsurely must know it,’ replied Little Red-Cap.\r\n\r\nThe wolf thought to himself: ‘What a tender young creature! what a nice\r\nplump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must\r\nact craftily, so as to catch both.’ So he walked for a short time by\r\nthe side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: ‘See, Little Red-Cap, how\r\npretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round? I believe,\r\ntoo, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you\r\nwalk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else\r\nout here in the wood is merry.’\r\n\r\nLittle Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing\r\nhere and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere,\r\nshe thought: ‘Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would\r\nplease her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there\r\nin good time’; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for\r\nflowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a\r\nstill prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and\r\ndeeper into the wood.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother’s house and knocked\r\nat the door.\r\n\r\n‘Who is there?’\r\n\r\n‘Little Red-Cap,’ replied the wolf. ‘She is bringing cake and wine; open\r\nthe door.’\r\n\r\n‘Lift the latch,’ called out the grandmother, ‘I am too weak, and cannot\r\nget up.’\r\n\r\nThe wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a\r\nword he went straight to the grandmother’s bed, and devoured her. Then\r\nhe put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed\r\nand drew the curtains.\r\n\r\nLittle Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers,\r\nand when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she\r\nremembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.\r\n\r\nShe was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she\r\nwent into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to\r\nherself: ‘Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like\r\nbeing with grandmother so much.’ She called out: ‘Good morning,’ but\r\nreceived no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.\r\nThere lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and\r\nlooking very strange.\r\n\r\n‘Oh! grandmother,’ she said, ‘what big ears you have!’\r\n\r\n‘The better to hear you with, my child,’ was the reply.\r\n\r\n‘But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!’ she said.\r\n\r\n‘The better to see you with, my dear.’\r\n\r\n‘But, grandmother, what large hands you have!’\r\n\r\n‘The better to hug you with.’\r\n\r\n‘Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!’\r\n\r\n‘The better to eat you with!’\r\n\r\nAnd scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of\r\nbed and swallowed up Red-Cap.\r\n\r\nWhen the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed,\r\nfell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing\r\nthe house, and thought to himself: ‘How the old woman is snoring! I must\r\njust see if she wants anything.’ So he went into the room, and when he\r\ncame to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. ‘Do I find you\r\nhere, you old sinner!’ said he. ‘I have long sought you!’ Then just as\r\nhe was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have\r\ndevoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did\r\nnot fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach\r\nof the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little\r\nRed-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl\r\nsprang out, crying: ‘Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was\r\ninside the wolf’; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive\r\nalso, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched\r\ngreat stones with which they filled the wolf’s belly, and when he awoke,\r\nhe wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at\r\nonce, and fell dead.\r\n\r\nThen all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf’s skin and\r\nwent home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which\r\nRed-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: ‘As\r\nlong as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the\r\nwood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.’\r\n\r\n\r\nIt also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old\r\ngrandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the\r\npath. Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on\r\nher way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he\r\nhad said ‘good morning’ to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes,\r\nthat if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would\r\nhave eaten her up. ‘Well,’ said the grandmother, ‘we will shut the door,\r\nthat he may not come in.’ Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried:\r\n‘Open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you\r\nsome cakes.’ But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard\r\nstole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof,\r\nintending to wait until Red-Cap went home in the evening, and then to\r\nsteal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother\r\nsaw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone\r\ntrough, so she said to the child: ‘Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some\r\nsausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the\r\ntrough.’ Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the\r\nsmell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down,\r\nand at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep\r\nhis footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight\r\ninto the great trough, and was drowned. But Red-Cap went joyously home,\r\nand no one ever did anything to harm her again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROBBER BRIDEGROOM\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was\r\ngrown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided\r\nfor. He said to himself, ‘I will give her to the first suitable man who\r\ncomes and asks for her hand.’ Not long after a suitor appeared, and as\r\nhe appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him with\r\nwhich to find fault, he betrothed his daughter to him. But the girl did\r\nnot care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband.\r\nShe did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him\r\nnor think of him without an inward shudder. One day he said to her, ‘You\r\nhave not yet paid me a visit, although we have been betrothed for some\r\ntime.’ ‘I do not know where your house is,’ she answered. ‘My house is\r\nout there in the dark forest,’ he said. She tried to excuse herself by\r\nsaying that she would not be able to find the way thither. Her betrothed\r\nonly replied, ‘You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already\r\ninvited guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I\r\nwill strew ashes along the path.’\r\n\r\nWhen Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of\r\ndread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might\r\nbe able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and\r\nlentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching the\r\nentrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these\r\nshe followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at every\r\nstep she took. She walked the whole day until she came to the deepest,\r\ndarkest part of the forest. There she saw a lonely house, looking so\r\ngrim and mysterious, that it did not please her at all. She stepped\r\ninside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence reigned\r\nthroughout. Suddenly a voice cried:\r\n\r\n ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\r\n  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’\r\n\r\nThe girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a\r\ncage on the wall. Again it cried:\r\n\r\n ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\r\n  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’\r\n\r\nThe girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they were\r\nall empty, and still she saw no one. At last she came to the cellar,\r\nand there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head from\r\nshaking. ‘Can you tell me,’ asked the girl, ‘if my betrothed husband\r\nlives here?’\r\n\r\n‘Ah, you poor child,’ answered the old woman, ‘what a place for you to\r\ncome to! This is a murderers’ den. You think yourself a promised bride,\r\nand that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with death that\r\nyou will keep your marriage feast. Look, do you see that large cauldron\r\nof water which I am obliged to keep on the fire! As soon as they have\r\nyou in their power they will kill you without mercy, and cook and eat\r\nyou, for they are eaters of men. If I did not take pity on you and save\r\nyou, you would be lost.’\r\n\r\nThereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid her\r\nfrom view. ‘Keep as still as a mouse,’ she said; ‘do not move or speak,\r\nor it will be all over with you. Tonight, when the robbers are\r\nall asleep, we will flee together. I have long been waiting for an\r\nopportunity to escape.’\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned,\r\ndragging another young girl along with them. They were all drunk, and\r\npaid no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her wine to drink,\r\nthree glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow,\r\nand with that her heart gave way and she died. Then they tore off her\r\ndainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into\r\npieces, and sprinkled salt upon it.\r\n\r\nThe poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the\r\ncask, for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by\r\nthe robbers. One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on\r\nthe little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off\r\neasily, he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang\r\ninto the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was\r\nhiding there. The robber took a light and began looking for it, but he\r\ncould not find it. ‘Have you looked behind the large cask?’ said one of\r\nthe others. But the old woman called out, ‘Come and eat your suppers,\r\nand let the thing be till tomorrow; the finger won’t run away.’\r\n\r\n‘The old woman is right,’ said the robbers, and they ceased looking for\r\nthe finger and sat down.\r\n\r\nThe old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine, and before\r\nlong they were all lying on the floor of the cellar, fast asleep and\r\nsnoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this, she came from behind\r\nthe cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who\r\nwere lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed\r\ndread lest she should awaken them. But God helped her, so that she\r\npassed safely over them, and then she and the old woman went upstairs,\r\nopened the door, and hastened as fast as they could from the murderers’\r\nden. They found the ashes scattered by the wind, but the peas and\r\nlentils had sprouted, and grown sufficiently above the ground, to guide\r\nthem in the moonlight along the path. All night long they walked, and it\r\nwas morning before they reached the mill. Then the girl told her father\r\nall that had happened.\r\n\r\nThe day came that had been fixed for the marriage. The bridegroom\r\narrived and also a large company of guests, for the miller had taken\r\ncare to invite all his friends and relations. As they sat at the feast,\r\neach guest in turn was asked to tell a tale; the bride sat still and did\r\nnot say a word.\r\n\r\n‘And you, my love,’ said the bridegroom, turning to her, ‘is there no\r\ntale you know? Tell us something.’\r\n\r\n‘I will tell you a dream, then,’ said the bride. ‘I went alone through a\r\nforest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within, but\r\na bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried:\r\n\r\n ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,\r\n  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’\r\n\r\nand again a second time it said these words.’\r\n\r\n‘My darling, this is only a dream.’\r\n\r\n‘I went on through the house from room to room, but they were all empty,\r\nand everything was so grim and mysterious. At last I went down to the\r\ncellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her\r\nhead still. I asked her if my betrothed lived here, and she answered,\r\n“Ah, you poor child, you are come to a murderers’ den; your betrothed\r\ndoes indeed live here, but he will kill you without mercy and afterwards\r\ncook and eat you.”’\r\n\r\n‘My darling, this is only a dream.’\r\n\r\n‘The old woman hid me behind a large cask, and scarcely had she done\r\nthis when the robbers returned home, dragging a young girl along with\r\nthem. They gave her three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and\r\nyellow, and with that she died.’\r\n\r\n‘My darling, this is only a dream.’\r\n\r\n‘Then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body into\r\npieces and sprinkled salt upon it.’\r\n\r\n‘My darling, this is only a dream.’\r\n\r\n‘And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on her\r\nfinger, and as it was difficult to draw off, he took a hatchet and cut\r\noff her finger; but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind the\r\ngreat cask into my lap. And here is the finger with the ring.’ And\r\nwith these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to the\r\nassembled guests.\r\n\r\nThe bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and\r\ntried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast. They\r\ndelivered him up to justice, and he and all his murderous band were\r\ncondemned to death for their wicked deeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOM THUMB\r\n\r\n\r\nA poor woodman sat in his cottage one night, smoking his pipe by the\r\nfireside, while his wife sat by his side spinning. ‘How lonely it is,\r\nwife,’ said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, ‘for you and me\r\nto sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse\r\nus while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!’\r\n‘What you say is very true,’ said the wife, sighing, and turning round\r\nher wheel; ‘how happy should I be if I had but one child! If it were\r\never so small--nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb--I should be very\r\nhappy, and love it dearly.’ Now--odd as you may think it--it came to\r\npass that this good woman’s wish was fulfilled, just in the very way she\r\nhad wished it; for, not long afterwards, she had a little boy, who was\r\nquite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb. So\r\nthey said, ‘Well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and,\r\nlittle as he is, we will love him dearly.’ And they called him Thomas\r\nThumb.\r\n\r\nThey gave him plenty of food, yet for all they could do he never grew\r\nbigger, but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born.\r\nStill, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to\r\nbe a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about.\r\n\r\nOne day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut\r\nfuel, he said, ‘I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me, for I\r\nwant to make haste.’ ‘Oh, father,’ cried Tom, ‘I will take care of that;\r\nthe cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it.’ Then the woodman\r\nlaughed, and said, ‘How can that be? you cannot reach up to the horse’s\r\nbridle.’ ‘Never mind that, father,’ said Tom; ‘if my mother will only\r\nharness the horse, I will get into his ear and tell him which way to\r\ngo.’ ‘Well,’ said the father, ‘we will try for once.’\r\n\r\nWhen the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put\r\nTom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how\r\nto go, crying out, ‘Go on!’ and ‘Stop!’ as he wanted: and thus the horse\r\nwent on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the\r\nwood. It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast, and Tom\r\nwas calling out, ‘Gently! gently!’ two strangers came up. ‘What an odd\r\nthing that is!’ said one: ‘there is a cart going along, and I hear a\r\ncarter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no one.’ ‘That is queer,\r\nindeed,’ said the other; ‘let us follow the cart, and see where it\r\ngoes.’ So they went on into the wood, till at last they came to the\r\nplace where the woodman was. Then Tom Thumb, seeing his father, cried\r\nout, ‘See, father, here I am with the cart, all right and safe! now take\r\nme down!’ So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with\r\nthe other took his son out of the horse’s ear, and put him down upon a\r\nstraw, where he sat as merry as you please.\r\n\r\nThe two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what\r\nto say for wonder. At last one took the other aside, and said, ‘That\r\nlittle urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him\r\nabout from town to town as a show; we must buy him.’ So they went up to\r\nthe woodman, and asked him what he would take for the little man. ‘He\r\nwill be better off,’ said they, ‘with us than with you.’ ‘I won’t sell\r\nhim at all,’ said the father; ‘my own flesh and blood is dearer to me\r\nthan all the silver and gold in the world.’ But Tom, hearing of the\r\nbargain they wanted to make, crept up his father’s coat to his shoulder\r\nand whispered in his ear, ‘Take the money, father, and let them have me;\r\nI’ll soon come back to you.’\r\n\r\nSo the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a\r\nlarge piece of gold, and they paid the price. ‘Where would you like to\r\nsit?’ said one of them. ‘Oh, put me on the rim of your hat; that will be\r\na nice gallery for me; I can walk about there and see the country as we\r\ngo along.’ So they did as he wished; and when Tom had taken leave of his\r\nfather they took him away with them.\r\n\r\nThey journeyed on till it began to be dusky, and then the little man\r\nsaid, ‘Let me get down, I’m tired.’ So the man took off his hat, and\r\nput him down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of the\r\nroad. But Tom ran about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped into\r\nan old mouse-hole. ‘Good night, my masters!’ said he, ‘I’m off! mind and\r\nlook sharp after me the next time.’ Then they ran at once to the place,\r\nand poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain;\r\nTom only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it became quite\r\ndark, so that they were forced to go their way without their prize, as\r\nsulky as could be.\r\n\r\nWhen Tom found they were gone, he came out of his hiding-place. ‘What\r\ndangerous walking it is,’ said he, ‘in this ploughed field! If I were to\r\nfall from one of these great clods, I should undoubtedly break my neck.’\r\nAt last, by good luck, he found a large empty snail-shell. ‘This is\r\nlucky,’ said he, ‘I can sleep here very well’; and in he crept.\r\n\r\nJust as he was falling asleep, he heard two men passing by, chatting\r\ntogether; and one said to the other, ‘How can we rob that rich parson’s\r\nhouse of his silver and gold?’ ‘I’ll tell you!’ cried Tom. ‘What noise\r\nwas that?’ said the thief, frightened; ‘I’m sure I heard someone speak.’\r\nThey stood still listening, and Tom said, ‘Take me with you, and I’ll\r\nsoon show you how to get the parson’s money.’ ‘But where are you?’ said\r\nthey. ‘Look about on the ground,’ answered he, ‘and listen where the\r\nsound comes from.’ At last the thieves found him out, and lifted him\r\nup in their hands. ‘You little urchin!’ they said, ‘what can you do for\r\nus?’ ‘Why, I can get between the iron window-bars of the parson’s house,\r\nand throw you out whatever you want.’ ‘That’s a good thought,’ said the\r\nthieves; ‘come along, we shall see what you can do.’\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the parson’s house, Tom slipped through the\r\nwindow-bars into the room, and then called out as loud as he could bawl,\r\n‘Will you have all that is here?’ At this the thieves were frightened,\r\nand said, ‘Softly, softly! Speak low, that you may not awaken anybody.’\r\nBut Tom seemed as if he did not understand them, and bawled out again,\r\n‘How much will you have? Shall I throw it all out?’ Now the cook lay in\r\nthe next room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and\r\nlistened. Meantime the thieves were frightened, and ran off a little\r\nway; but at last they plucked up their hearts, and said, ‘The little\r\nurchin is only trying to make fools of us.’ So they came back and\r\nwhispered softly to him, saying, ‘Now let us have no more of your\r\nroguish jokes; but throw us out some of the money.’ Then Tom called out\r\nas loud as he could, ‘Very well! hold your hands! here it comes.’\r\n\r\nThe cook heard this quite plain, so she sprang out of bed, and ran to\r\nopen the door. The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails: and\r\nthe maid, having groped about and found nothing, went away for a light.\r\nBy the time she came back, Tom had slipped off into the barn; and when\r\nshe had looked about and searched every hole and corner, and found\r\nnobody, she went to bed, thinking she must have been dreaming with her\r\neyes open.\r\n\r\nThe little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug\r\nplace to finish his night’s rest in; so he laid himself down, meaning\r\nto sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and\r\nmother. But alas! how woefully he was undone! what crosses and sorrows\r\nhappen to us all in this world! The cook got up early, before daybreak,\r\nto feed the cows; and going straight to the hay-loft, carried away\r\na large bundle of hay, with the little man in the middle of it, fast\r\nasleep. He still, however, slept on, and did not awake till he found\r\nhimself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the\r\ncow’s rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it. ‘Good\r\nlack-a-day!’ said he, ‘how came I to tumble into the mill?’ But he soon\r\nfound out where he really was; and was forced to have all his wits about\r\nhim, that he might not get between the cow’s teeth, and so be crushed to\r\ndeath. At last down he went into her stomach. ‘It is rather dark,’ said\r\nhe; ‘they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in; a\r\ncandle would be no bad thing.’\r\n\r\nThough he made the best of his bad luck, he did not like his quarters at\r\nall; and the worst of it was, that more and more hay was always coming\r\ndown, and the space left for him became smaller and smaller. At last he\r\ncried out as loud as he could, ‘Don’t bring me any more hay! Don’t bring\r\nme any more hay!’\r\n\r\nThe maid happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing someone\r\nspeak, but seeing nobody, and yet being quite sure it was the same voice\r\nthat she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she fell off\r\nher stool, and overset the milk-pail. As soon as she could pick herself\r\nup out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could to her master the\r\nparson, and said, ‘Sir, sir, the cow is talking!’ But the parson\r\nsaid, ‘Woman, thou art surely mad!’ However, he went with her into the\r\ncow-house, to try and see what was the matter.\r\n\r\nScarcely had they set foot on the threshold, when Tom called out, ‘Don’t\r\nbring me any more hay!’ Then the parson himself was frightened; and\r\nthinking the cow was surely bewitched, told his man to kill her on the\r\nspot. So the cow was killed, and cut up; and the stomach, in which Tom\r\nlay, was thrown out upon a dunghill.\r\n\r\nTom soon set himself to work to get out, which was not a very easy\r\ntask; but at last, just as he had made room to get his head out, fresh\r\nill-luck befell him. A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up the\r\nwhole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away.\r\n\r\nTom, however, was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would\r\nnot dislike having some chat with him as he was going along, he called\r\nout, ‘My good friend, I can show you a famous treat.’ ‘Where’s that?’\r\nsaid the wolf. ‘In such and such a house,’ said Tom, describing his own\r\nfather’s house. ‘You can crawl through the drain into the kitchen and\r\nthen into the pantry, and there you will find cakes, ham, beef, cold\r\nchicken, roast pig, apple-dumplings, and everything that your heart can\r\nwish.’\r\n\r\nThe wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to\r\nthe house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and then into\r\nthe pantry, and ate and drank there to his heart’s content. As soon as\r\nhe had had enough he wanted to get away; but he had eaten so much that\r\nhe could not go out by the same way he came in.\r\n\r\nThis was just what Tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to set up a\r\ngreat shout, making all the noise he could. ‘Will you be easy?’ said the\r\nwolf; ‘you’ll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter.’\r\n‘What’s that to me?’ said the little man; ‘you have had your frolic, now\r\nI’ve a mind to be merry myself’; and he began, singing and shouting as\r\nloud as he could.\r\n\r\nThe woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through\r\na crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well\r\nsuppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his\r\naxe, and gave his wife a scythe. ‘Do you stay behind,’ said the woodman,\r\n‘and when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with the\r\nscythe.’ Tom heard all this, and cried out, ‘Father, father! I am here,\r\nthe wolf has swallowed me.’ And his father said, ‘Heaven be praised! we\r\nhave found our dear child again’; and he told his wife not to use the\r\nscythe for fear she should hurt him. Then he aimed a great blow, and\r\nstruck the wolf on the head, and killed him on the spot! and when he was\r\ndead they cut open his body, and set Tommy free. ‘Ah!’ said the father,\r\n‘what fears we have had for you!’ ‘Yes, father,’ answered he; ‘I have\r\ntravelled all over the world, I think, in one way or other, since we\r\nparted; and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again.’\r\n‘Why, where have you been?’ said his father. ‘I have been in a\r\nmouse-hole--and in a snail-shell--and down a cow’s throat--and in the\r\nwolf’s belly; and yet here I am again, safe and sound.’\r\n\r\n‘Well,’ said they, ‘you are come back, and we will not sell you again\r\nfor all the riches in the world.’\r\n\r\nThen they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty\r\nto eat and drink, for he was very hungry; and then they fetched new\r\nclothes for him, for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey.\r\nSo Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother, in peace; for\r\nthough he had been so great a traveller, and had done and seen so many\r\nfine things, and was fond enough of telling the whole story, he always\r\nagreed that, after all, there’s no place like HOME!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUMPELSTILTSKIN\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream\r\nof water; and upon the stream there stood a mill. The miller’s house was\r\nclose by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter.\r\nShe was, moreover, very shrewd and clever; and the miller was so proud\r\nof her, that he one day told the king of the land, who used to come and\r\nhunt in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Now\r\nthis king was very fond of money; and when he heard the miller’s boast\r\nhis greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be brought before\r\nhim. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great\r\nheap of straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, ‘All this must\r\nbe spun into gold before morning, as you love your life.’ It was in vain\r\nthat the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father,\r\nfor that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber\r\ndoor was locked, and she was left alone.\r\n\r\nShe sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard\r\nfate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man\r\nhobbled in, and said, ‘Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you\r\nweeping for?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘I must spin this straw into gold, and\r\nI know not how.’ ‘What will you give me,’ said the hobgoblin, ‘to do it\r\nfor you?’ ‘My necklace,’ replied the maiden. He took her at her word,\r\nand sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang:\r\n\r\n ‘Round about, round about,\r\n    Lo and behold!\r\n  Reel away, reel away,\r\n    Straw into gold!’\r\n\r\nAnd round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and\r\nthe straw was all spun into gold.\r\n\r\nWhen the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and pleased;\r\nbut his heart grew still more greedy of gain, and he shut up the poor\r\nmiller’s daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to do,\r\nand sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door, and\r\nsaid, ‘What will you give me to do your task?’ ‘The ring on my finger,’\r\nsaid she. So her little friend took the ring, and began to work at the\r\nwheel again, and whistled and sang:\r\n\r\n ‘Round about, round about,\r\n    Lo and behold!\r\n  Reel away, reel away,\r\n    Straw into gold!’\r\n\r\ntill, long before morning, all was done again.\r\n\r\nThe king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure;\r\nbut still he had not enough: so he took the miller’s daughter to a yet\r\nlarger heap, and said, ‘All this must be spun tonight; and if it is,\r\nyou shall be my queen.’ As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in, and\r\nsaid, ‘What will you give me to spin gold for you this third time?’\r\n‘I have nothing left,’ said she. ‘Then say you will give me,’ said\r\nthe little man, ‘the first little child that you may have when you are\r\nqueen.’ ‘That may never be,’ thought the miller’s daughter: and as she\r\nknew no other way to get her task done, she said she would do what he\r\nasked. Round went the wheel again to the old song, and the manikin once\r\nmore spun the heap into gold. The king came in the morning, and, finding\r\nall he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so he married the miller’s\r\ndaughter, and she really became queen.\r\n\r\nAt the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the\r\ndwarf, and what she had said. But one day he came into her room, where\r\nshe was sitting playing with her baby, and put her in mind of it. Then\r\nshe grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give him all\r\nthe wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in vain; till at\r\nlast her tears softened him, and he said, ‘I will give you three days’\r\ngrace, and if during that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your\r\nchild.’\r\n\r\nNow the queen lay awake all night, thinking of all the odd names that\r\nshe had ever heard; and she sent messengers all over the land to find\r\nout new ones. The next day the little man came, and she began with\r\nTIMOTHY, ICHABOD, BENJAMIN, JEREMIAH, and all the names she could\r\nremember; but to all and each of them he said, ‘Madam, that is not my\r\nname.’\r\n\r\nThe second day she began with all the comical names she could hear of,\r\nBANDY-LEGS, HUNCHBACK, CROOK-SHANKS, and so on; but the little gentleman\r\nstill said to every one of them, ‘Madam, that is not my name.’\r\n\r\nThe third day one of the messengers came back, and said, ‘I have\r\ntravelled two days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday, as\r\nI was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the fox\r\nand the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and before\r\nthe hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny little dwarf was\r\ndancing upon one leg, and singing:\r\n\r\n “Merrily the feast I’ll make.\r\n  Today I’ll brew, tomorrow bake;\r\n  Merrily I’ll dance and sing,\r\n  For next day will a stranger bring.\r\n  Little does my lady dream\r\n  Rumpelstiltskin is my name!”\r\n\r\nWhen the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as soon as her little\r\nfriend came she sat down upon her throne, and called all her court round\r\nto enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her\r\narms, as if it was quite ready to be given up. Then the little man began\r\nto chuckle at the thought of having the poor child, to take home with\r\nhim to his hut in the woods; and he cried out, ‘Now, lady, what is my\r\nname?’ ‘Is it JOHN?’ asked she. ‘No, madam!’ ‘Is it TOM?’ ‘No, madam!’\r\n‘Is it JEMMY?’ ‘It is not.’ ‘Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN?’ said the\r\nlady slyly. ‘Some witch told you that!--some witch told you that!’ cried\r\nthe little man, and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the\r\nfloor, that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThen he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and the\r\nbaby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much\r\ntrouble for nothing, and said, ‘We wish you a very good morning, and a\r\nmerry feast, Mr RUMPLESTILTSKIN!’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEVER GRETEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and\r\nwhen she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that,\r\nwas quite happy and thought: ‘You certainly are a pretty girl!’ And when\r\nshe came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine,\r\nand as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she\r\nwas cooking until she was satisfied, and said: ‘The cook must know what\r\nthe food is like.’\r\n\r\nIt came to pass that the master one day said to her: ‘Gretel, there is a\r\nguest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.’ ‘I will\r\nsee to it, master,’ answered Gretel. She killed two fowls, scalded them,\r\nplucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before\r\nthe fire, that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown, and were\r\nnearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called out\r\nto her master: ‘If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away\r\nfrom the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten\r\nthe moment they are at their juiciest.’ The master said: ‘I will run\r\nmyself, and fetch the guest.’ When the master had turned his back,\r\nGretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: ‘Standing\r\nso long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows\r\nwhen they will come? Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a\r\ndrink.’ She ran down, set a jug, said: ‘God bless it for you, Gretel,’\r\nand took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should\r\nnot be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.\r\n\r\nThen she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them,\r\nand drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good,\r\nGretel thought: ‘Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!’\r\nShe touched it with her finger, and said: ‘Ah! how good fowls are! It\r\ncertainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right\r\ntime!’ She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with\r\nhis guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought:\r\n‘One of the wings is burning! I had better take it off and eat it.’\r\nSo she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she\r\nthought: ‘The other must go down too, or else master will observe that\r\nsomething is missing.’ When the two wings were eaten, she went and\r\nlooked for her master, and did not see him. It suddenly occurred to\r\nher: ‘Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in\r\nsomewhere.’ Then she said: ‘Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has\r\nbeen cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is\r\neaten you will have some peace, why should God’s good gifts be spoilt?’\r\nSo she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the\r\none chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed down,\r\nand still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said:\r\n‘What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what’s\r\nright for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take\r\nanother draught it would do me no harm.’ So she took another hearty\r\ndrink, and let the second chicken follow the first.\r\n\r\nWhile she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: ‘Hurry\r\nup, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!’ ‘Yes, sir, I will\r\nsoon serve up,’ answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to see that\r\nthe table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was\r\ngoing to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps. Presently\r\nthe guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door.\r\nGretel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest,\r\nshe put her finger to her lips and said: ‘Hush! hush! go away as quickly\r\nas you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he\r\ncertainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your\r\ntwo ears. Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!’ The guest\r\nheard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he\r\ncould. Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried:\r\n‘You have invited a fine guest!’ ‘Why, Gretel? What do you mean by\r\nthat?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘he has taken the chickens which I was just\r\ngoing to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!’ ‘That’s a\r\nnice trick!’ said her master, and lamented the fine chickens. ‘If he had\r\nbut left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.’ He called to\r\nhim to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him\r\nwith the knife still in his hand, crying: ‘Just one, just one,’ meaning\r\nthat the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both. The\r\nguest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of\r\nhis ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take\r\nthem both with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD MAN AND HIS GRANDSON\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull\r\nof hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly\r\nhold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run\r\nout of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so\r\nthe old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,\r\nand they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough\r\nof it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of\r\ntears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it\r\nfell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said\r\nnothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few\r\nhalf-pence, out of which he had to eat.\r\n\r\nThey were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old\r\nbegan to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are\r\nyou doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’\r\nanswered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’\r\n\r\nThe man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently\r\nbegan to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and\r\nhenceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he\r\ndid spill a little of anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE PEASANT\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich\r\npeasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. He\r\nhad not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and\r\nyet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her:\r\n‘Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall\r\nmake us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any\r\nother, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.’ the woman\r\nalso liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed\r\nthe calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head\r\nhanging down as if it were eating.\r\n\r\nNext morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant\r\ncalled the cow-herd in and said: ‘Look, I have a little calf there,\r\nbut it is still small and has to be carried.’ The cow-herd said: ‘All\r\nright,’ and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set\r\nit among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like one\r\nwhich was eating, and the cow-herd said: ‘It will soon run by itself,\r\njust look how it eats already!’ At night when he was going to drive the\r\nherd home again, he said to the calf: ‘If you can stand there and eat\r\nyour fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don’t care to drag you\r\nhome again in my arms.’ But the little peasant stood at his door, and\r\nwaited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through\r\nthe village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was. The\r\ncow-herd answered: ‘It is still standing out there eating. It would not\r\nstop and come with us.’ But the little peasant said: ‘Oh, but I must\r\nhave my beast back again.’ Then they went back to the meadow together,\r\nbut someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone. The cow-herd said: ‘It\r\nmust have run away.’ The peasant, however, said: ‘Don’t tell me\r\nthat,’ and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness\r\ncondemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.\r\n\r\nAnd now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had\r\nso long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for\r\nit, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. They\r\nsalted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell\r\nthe skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On\r\nthe way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings,\r\nand out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. But as the\r\nweather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could\r\ngo no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. The\r\nmiller’s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: ‘Lay\r\nyourself on the straw there,’ and gave him a slice of bread and cheese.\r\nThe peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman\r\nthought: ‘He is tired and has gone to sleep.’ In the meantime came the\r\nparson; the miller’s wife received him well, and said: ‘My husband is\r\nout, so we will have a feast.’ The peasant listened, and when he heard\r\nthem talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make\r\nshift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then the woman served up four\r\ndifferent things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.\r\n\r\nJust as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking\r\noutside. The woman said: ‘Oh, heavens! It is my husband!’ she quickly\r\nhid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow,\r\nthe salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet\r\non the porch. Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: ‘Thank\r\nheaven, you are back again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the\r\nworld were coming to an end.’ The miller saw the peasant lying on the\r\nstraw, and asked, ‘What is that fellow doing there?’ ‘Ah,’ said the\r\nwife, ‘the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for\r\nshelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where\r\nthe straw was.’ The man said: ‘I have no objection, but be quick and get\r\nme something to eat.’ The woman said: ‘But I have nothing but bread and\r\ncheese.’ ‘I am contented with anything,’ replied the husband, ‘so far as\r\nI am concerned, bread and cheese will do,’ and looked at the peasant and\r\nsaid: ‘Come and eat some more with me.’ The peasant did not require to\r\nbe invited twice, but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skin\r\nin which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: ‘What have you\r\nthere?’ The peasant answered: ‘I have a soothsayer inside it.’ ‘Can\r\nhe foretell anything to me?’ said the miller. ‘Why not?’ answered\r\nthe peasant: ‘but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to\r\nhimself.’ The miller was curious, and said: ‘Let him foretell something\r\nfor once.’ Then the peasant pinched the raven’s head, so that he croaked\r\nand made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said: ‘What did he say?’ The\r\npeasant answered: ‘In the first place, he says that there is some wine\r\nhidden under the pillow.’ ‘Bless me!’ cried the miller, and went there\r\nand found the wine. ‘Now go on,’ said he. The peasant made the raven\r\ncroak again, and said: ‘In the second place, he says that there is some\r\nroast meat in the tiled stove.’ ‘Upon my word!’ cried the miller, and\r\nwent thither, and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven\r\nprophesy still more, and said: ‘Thirdly, he says that there is some\r\nsalad on the bed.’ ‘That would be a fine thing!’ cried the miller, and\r\nwent there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven\r\nonce more till he croaked, and said: ‘Fourthly, he says that there\r\nare some cakes under the bed.’ ‘That would be a fine thing!’ cried the\r\nmiller, and looked there, and found the cakes.\r\n\r\nAnd now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller’s wife\r\nwas frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with\r\nher. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little\r\npeasant said: ‘First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth\r\nis something bad.’ So they ate, and after that they bargained how much\r\nthe miller was to give for the fifth prophecy, until they agreed on\r\nthree hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched the raven’s\r\nhead till he croaked loudly. The miller asked: ‘What did he say?’ The\r\npeasant replied: ‘He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in\r\nthe closet on the porch.’ The miller said: ‘The Devil must go out,’ and\r\nopened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys,\r\nand the peasant unlocked the closet. The parson ran out as fast as he\r\ncould, and the miller said: ‘It was true; I saw the black rascal with my\r\nown eyes.’ The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with\r\nthe three hundred talers.\r\n\r\nAt home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful\r\nhouse, and the peasants said: ‘The small peasant has certainly been to\r\nthe place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in\r\nshovels.’ Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and\r\nbidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered: ‘I sold my cow’s\r\nskin in the town, for three hundred talers.’ When the peasants heard\r\nthat, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed\r\nall their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in\r\nthe town to the greatest advantage. The mayor, however, said: ‘But my\r\nservant must go first.’ When she came to the merchant in the town, he\r\ndid not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others\r\ncame, he did not give them so much, and said: ‘What can I do with all\r\nthese skins?’\r\n\r\nThen the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus\r\noutwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this\r\ntreachery before the mayor. The innocent little peasant was unanimously\r\nsentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel\r\npierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest was brought who\r\nwas to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire to\r\na distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the\r\nman who had been with the miller’s wife. He said to him: ‘I set you free\r\nfrom the closet, set me free from the barrel.’ At this same moment up\r\ncame, with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had\r\nlong been wishing to be mayor, so he cried with all his might: ‘No, I\r\nwill not do it; if the whole world insists on it, I will not do it!’ The\r\nshepherd hearing that, came up to him, and asked: ‘What are you about?\r\nWhat is it that you will not do?’ The peasant said: ‘They want to make\r\nme mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.’\r\nThe shepherd said: ‘If nothing more than that is needful in order to be\r\nmayor, I would get into the barrel at once.’ The peasant said: ‘If you\r\nwill get in, you will be mayor.’ The shepherd was willing, and got in,\r\nand the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd’s\r\nflock for himself, and drove it away. The parson went to the crowd,\r\nand declared that the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the\r\nbarrel towards the water. When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd\r\ncried: ‘I am quite willing to be mayor.’ They believed no otherwise than\r\nthat it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered: ‘That is\r\nwhat we intend, but first you shall look about you a little down below\r\nthere,’ and they rolled the barrel down into the water.\r\n\r\nAfter that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the\r\nvillage, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of\r\nsheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished,\r\nand said: ‘Peasant, from whence do you come? Have you come out of the\r\nwater?’ ‘Yes, truly,’ replied the peasant, ‘I sank deep, deep down,\r\nuntil at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the\r\nbarrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number\r\nof lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with\r\nme.’ Said the peasants: ‘Are there any more there?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ said he,\r\n‘more than I could want.’ Then the peasants made up their minds that\r\nthey too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the\r\nmayor said: ‘I come first.’ So they went to the water together, and just\r\nthen there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which\r\nare called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon\r\nthe peasants cried: ‘We already see the sheep down below!’ The mayor\r\npressed forward and said: ‘I will go down first, and look about me, and\r\nif things promise well I’ll call you.’ So he jumped in; splash! went\r\nthe water; it sounded as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd\r\nplunged in after him as one man. Then the entire village was dead, and\r\nthe small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFREDERICK AND CATHERINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was\r\nCatherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said.\r\n‘Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be\r\nhungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.’\r\n‘Very well,’ said she, ‘it shall all be ready.’ When dinner-time drew\r\nnigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and\r\nput it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to\r\ncrackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it:\r\nthen she said to herself, ‘The steak is almost ready, I may as well go\r\nto the cellar for the ale.’ So she left the pan on the fire and took a\r\nlarge jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran\r\ninto the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her\r\nhead, ‘The dog is not shut up--he may be running away with the steak;\r\nthat’s well thought of.’ So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough\r\nthe rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAway ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran\r\nfaster than she, and stuck close to the steak. ‘It’s all gone, and “what\r\ncan’t be cured must be endured”,’ said Catherine. So she turned round;\r\nand as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely\r\nto cool herself.\r\n\r\nNow all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned\r\nthe cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till\r\nthe cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had\r\nhappened. ‘My stars!’ said she, ‘what shall I do to keep Frederick from\r\nseeing all this slopping about?’ So she thought a while; and at last\r\nremembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair,\r\nand that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale\r\nnicely. ‘What a lucky thing,’ said she, ‘that we kept that meal! we have\r\nnow a good use for it.’ So away she went for it: but she managed to set\r\nit down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus\r\nall the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. ‘Ah!\r\nwell,’ said she, ‘when one goes another may as well follow.’ Then she\r\nstrewed the meal all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her\r\ncleverness, and said, ‘How very neat and clean it looks!’\r\n\r\nAt noon Frederick came home. ‘Now, wife,’ cried he, ‘what have you for\r\ndinner?’ ‘O Frederick!’ answered she, ‘I was cooking you a steak; but\r\nwhile I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while\r\nI ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale\r\nwith the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the\r\ncellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!’ ‘Kate, Kate,’ said he,\r\n‘how could you do all this?’ Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the\r\nale to run, and then spoil all the meal?’ ‘Why, Frederick,’ said she, ‘I\r\ndid not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.’\r\n\r\nThe husband thought to himself, ‘If my wife manages matters thus, I must\r\nlook sharp myself.’ Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he\r\nsaid to Catherine, ‘What pretty yellow buttons these are! I shall put\r\nthem into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you\r\nnever go near or meddle with them.’ ‘No, Frederick,’ said she, ‘that\r\nI never will.’ As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with\r\nearthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy.\r\n‘Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if\r\nyou had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with you.’ ‘Yellow\r\nbuttons!’ said they: ‘let us have a look at them.’ ‘Go into the garden\r\nand dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow buttons: I dare\r\nnot go myself.’ So the rogues went: and when they found what these\r\nyellow buttons were, they took them all away, and left her plenty of\r\nplates and dishes. Then she set them all about the house for a show:\r\nand when Frederick came back, he cried out, ‘Kate, what have you been\r\ndoing?’ ‘See,’ said she, ‘I have bought all these with your yellow\r\nbuttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves\r\nand dug them up.’ ‘Wife, wife,’ said Frederick, ‘what a pretty piece of\r\nwork you have made! those yellow buttons were all my money: how came you\r\nto do such a thing?’ ‘Why,’ answered she, ‘I did not know there was any\r\nharm in it; you should have told me.’\r\n\r\nCatherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband,\r\n‘Hark ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after\r\nthe thieves.’ ‘Well, we will try,’ answered he; ‘but take some butter\r\nand cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.’\r\n‘Very well,’ said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the\r\nfastest, he left his wife some way behind. ‘It does not matter,’ thought\r\nshe: ‘when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.’\r\n\r\nPresently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there\r\nwas a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees\r\non each side as they passed. ‘Ah, see now,’ said she, ‘how they have\r\nbruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.’ So she\r\ntook pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so\r\nthat the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this\r\nkind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down\r\nthe hill. Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she\r\nsaid, ‘Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he\r\nhas younger legs than I have.’ Then she rolled the other cheese after\r\nit; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill. But she said\r\nshe supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she\r\ncould not stay there all day waiting for them.\r\n\r\nAt last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to\r\neat. Then she gave him the dry bread. ‘Where are the butter and cheese?’\r\nsaid he. ‘Oh!’ answered she, ‘I used the butter to grease those poor\r\ntrees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I\r\nsent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on\r\nthe road together somewhere.’ ‘What a goose you are to do such silly\r\nthings!’ said the husband. ‘How can you say so?’ said she; ‘I am sure\r\nyou never told me not.’\r\n\r\nThey ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, ‘Kate, I hope you\r\nlocked the door safe when you came away.’ ‘No,’ answered she, ‘you did\r\nnot tell me.’ ‘Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,’\r\nsaid Frederick, ‘and bring with you something to eat.’\r\n\r\nCatherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way,\r\n‘Frederick wants something to eat; but I don’t think he is very fond of\r\nbutter and cheese: I’ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar,\r\nfor I have often seen him take some.’\r\n\r\nWhen she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she\r\ntook off the hinges, and said, ‘Frederick told me to lock the door, but\r\nsurely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.’ So she took\r\nher time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried\r\nout, ‘There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as\r\ncarefully as you please.’ ‘Alas! alas!’ said he, ‘what a clever wife I\r\nhave! I sent you to make the house fast, and you take the door away, so\r\nthat everybody may go in and out as they please--however, as you have\r\nbrought the door, you shall carry it about with you for your pains.’\r\n‘Very well,’ answered she, ‘I’ll carry the door; but I’ll not carry the\r\nnuts and vinegar bottle also--that would be too much of a load; so if\r\nyou please, I’ll fasten them to the door.’\r\n\r\nFrederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off\r\ninto the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and\r\nwhen it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there.\r\nScarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they\r\nwere looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that\r\nclass of people who find things before they are lost; they were tired;\r\nso they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and\r\nCatherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up\r\nsome stones. Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on\r\nthe head with them: but they only said, ‘It must be near morning, for\r\nthe wind shakes the fir-apples down.’\r\n\r\nCatherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired;\r\nbut she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said\r\nsoftly, ‘Frederick, I must let the nuts go.’ ‘No,’ answered he, ‘not\r\nnow, they will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that: they must go.’ ‘Well,\r\nthen, make haste and throw them down, if you will.’ Then away rattled\r\nthe nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried, ‘Bless me,\r\nit is hailing.’\r\n\r\nA little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy:\r\nso she whispered to Frederick, ‘I must throw the vinegar down.’ ‘Pray\r\ndon’t,’ answered he, ‘it will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that,’ said\r\nshe, ‘go it must.’ So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves\r\nsaid, ‘What a heavy dew there is!’\r\n\r\nAt last it popped into Catherine’s head that it was the door itself that\r\nwas so heavy all the time: so she whispered, ‘Frederick, I must throw\r\nthe door down soon.’ But he begged and prayed her not to do so, for he\r\nwas sure it would betray them. ‘Here goes, however,’ said she: and down\r\nwent the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they cried\r\nout ‘Murder!’ and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast as they\r\ncould, and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came down,\r\nthere they found all their money safe and sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEETHEART ROLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two\r\ndaughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she was\r\nher own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she hated,\r\nbecause she was her stepdaughter. The stepdaughter once had a pretty\r\napron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and\r\ntold her mother that she must and would have that apron. ‘Be quiet, my\r\nchild,’ said the old woman, ‘and you shall have it. Your stepsister has\r\nlong deserved death; tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut her\r\nhead off. Only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed, and\r\npush her well to the front.’ It would have been all over with the poor\r\ngirl if she had not just then been standing in a corner, and heard\r\neverything. All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime\r\nhad come, the witch’s daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the\r\nfar side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her gently to the\r\nfront, and took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall. In\r\nthe night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right\r\nhand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside,\r\nand then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own child’s\r\nhead off.\r\n\r\nWhen she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart, who\r\nwas called Roland, and knocked at his door. When he came out, she said\r\nto him: ‘Listen, dearest Roland, we must fly in all haste; my stepmother\r\nwanted to kill me, but has struck her own child. When daylight comes,\r\nand she sees what she has done, we shall be lost.’ ‘But,’ said Roland,\r\n‘I counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape\r\nif she pursues us.’ The maiden fetched the magic wand, and she took the\r\ndead girl’s head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground, one in\r\nfront of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs. Then she\r\nhurried away with her lover.\r\n\r\nWhen the old witch got up next morning, she called her daughter, and\r\nwanted to give her the apron, but she did not come. Then the witch\r\ncried: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping,’ answered\r\nthe first drop of blood. The old woman went out, but saw no one on the\r\nstairs, and cried again: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Here in the kitchen, I am\r\nwarming myself,’ cried the second drop of blood. She went into the\r\nkitchen, but found no one. Then she cried again: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Ah,\r\nhere in the bed, I am sleeping,’ cried the third drop of blood. She went\r\ninto the room to the bed. What did she see there? Her own child,\r\nwhose head she had cut off, bathed in her blood. The witch fell into\r\na passion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far\r\ninto the world, she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her\r\nsweetheart Roland. ‘That shall not help you,’ cried she, ‘even if you\r\nhave got a long way off, you shall still not escape me.’ She put on her\r\nmany-league boots, in which she covered an hour’s walk at every step,\r\nand it was not long before she overtook them. The girl, however, when\r\nshe saw the old woman striding towards her, changed, with her magic\r\nwand, her sweetheart Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck\r\nswimming in the middle of it. The witch placed herself on the shore,\r\nthrew breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice the duck;\r\nbut the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to\r\ngo home at night as she had come. At this the girl and her sweetheart\r\nRoland resumed their natural shapes again, and they walked on the whole\r\nnight until daybreak. Then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful\r\nflower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her sweetheart\r\nRoland into a fiddler. It was not long before the witch came striding up\r\ntowards them, and said to the musician: ‘Dear musician, may I pluck that\r\nbeautiful flower for myself?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ he replied, ‘I will play to\r\nyou while you do it.’ As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was\r\njust going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who the flower\r\nwas, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was forced\r\nto dance, for it was a magical dance. The faster he played, the more\r\nviolent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes\r\nfrom her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he\r\ndid not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.\r\n\r\nAs they were now set free, Roland said: ‘Now I will go to my father and\r\narrange for the wedding.’ ‘Then in the meantime I will stay here and\r\nwait for you,’ said the girl, ‘and that no one may recognize me, I will\r\nchange myself into a red stone landmark.’ Then Roland went away, and the\r\ngirl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved.\r\nBut when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another, who so\r\nfascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl remained there a\r\nlong time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and\r\nchanged herself into a flower, and thought: ‘Someone will surely come\r\nthis way, and trample me down.’\r\n\r\nIt befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and saw\r\nthe flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with him, and\r\nlaid it away in his chest. From that time forth, strange things happened\r\nin the shepherd’s house. When he arose in the morning, all the work was\r\nalready done, the room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the\r\nfire in the hearth was lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon,\r\nwhen he came home, the table was laid, and a good dinner served. He\r\ncould not conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being\r\nin his house, and no one could have concealed himself in it. He was\r\ncertainly pleased with this good attendance, but still at last he was so\r\nafraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice. The wise\r\nwoman said: ‘There is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some\r\nmorning if anything is moving in the room, and if you see anything, no\r\nmatter what it is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will\r\nbe stopped.’\r\n\r\nThe shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day dawned,\r\nhe saw the chest open, and the flower come out. Swiftly he\r\nsprang towards it, and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly the\r\ntransformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him,\r\nwho admitted to him that she had been the flower, and that up to this\r\ntime she had attended to his house-keeping. She told him her story,\r\nand as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she\r\nanswered: ‘No,’ for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart\r\nRoland, although he had deserted her. Nevertheless, she promised not to\r\ngo away, but to continue keeping house for the shepherd.\r\n\r\nAnd now the time drew near when Roland’s wedding was to be celebrated,\r\nand then, according to an old custom in the country, it was announced\r\nthat all the girls were to be present at it, and sing in honour of the\r\nbridal pair. When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad\r\nthat she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither,\r\nbut the other girls came and took her. When it came to her turn to sing,\r\nshe stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and then she\r\ncould not refuse. But when she began her song, and it reached Roland’s\r\nears, he sprang up and cried: ‘I know the voice, that is the true\r\nbride, I will have no other!’ Everything he had forgotten, and which had\r\nvanished from his mind, had suddenly come home again to his heart. Then\r\nthe faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and\r\ngrief came to an end and joy began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSNOWDROP\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling\r\naround, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working\r\nat her window. The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony, and\r\nas she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three\r\ndrops of blood fell upon it. Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red\r\ndrops that sprinkled the white snow, and said, ‘Would that my little\r\ndaughter may be as white as that snow, as red as that blood, and as\r\nblack as this ebony windowframe!’ And so the little girl really did grow\r\nup; her skin was as white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as the blood, and\r\nher hair as black as ebony; and she was called Snowdrop.\r\n\r\nBut this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who became\r\nqueen, and was very beautiful, but so vain that she could not bear\r\nto think that anyone could be handsomer than she was. She had a fairy\r\nlooking-glass, to which she used to go, and then she would gaze upon\r\nherself in it, and say:\r\n\r\n ‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!\r\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\r\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?’\r\n\r\nAnd the glass had always answered:\r\n\r\n ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all the land.’\r\n\r\nBut Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years\r\nold she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself.\r\nThen the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to look in it\r\nas usual:\r\n\r\n ‘Thou, queen, art fair, and beauteous to see,\r\n  But Snowdrop is lovelier far than thee!’\r\n\r\nWhen she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to\r\none of her servants, and said, ‘Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood,\r\nthat I may never see her any more.’ Then the servant led her away; but\r\nhis heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life, and he\r\nsaid, ‘I will not hurt you, thou pretty child.’ So he left her by\r\nherself; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would\r\ntear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his\r\nheart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to\r\nher fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her.\r\n\r\nThen poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear; and\r\nthe wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm. In the\r\nevening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for\r\nher little feet would carry her no further. Everything was spruce and\r\nneat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there\r\nwere seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little glasses\r\nwith wine in them; and seven knives and forks laid in order; and by\r\nthe wall stood seven little beds. As she was very hungry, she picked\r\na little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of each\r\nglass; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest. So she\r\ntried all the little beds; but one was too long, and another was too\r\nshort, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself\r\ndown and went to sleep.\r\n\r\nBy and by in came the masters of the cottage. Now they were seven little\r\ndwarfs, that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched for gold.\r\nThey lighted up their seven lamps, and saw at once that all was not\r\nright. The first said, ‘Who has been sitting on my stool?’ The second,\r\n‘Who has been eating off my plate?’ The third, ‘Who has been picking my\r\nbread?’ The fourth, ‘Who has been meddling with my spoon?’ The fifth,\r\n‘Who has been handling my fork?’ The sixth, ‘Who has been cutting with\r\nmy knife?’ The seventh, ‘Who has been drinking my wine?’ Then the first\r\nlooked round and said, ‘Who has been lying on my bed?’ And the rest came\r\nrunning to him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his\r\nbed. But the seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all his brethren to come\r\nand see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought\r\ntheir lamps to look at her, and said, ‘Good heavens! what a lovely child\r\nshe is!’ And they were very glad to see her, and took care not to wake\r\nher; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs\r\nin turn, till the night was gone.\r\n\r\nIn the morning Snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied her,\r\nand said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash and\r\nknit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would\r\ntake good care of her. Then they went out all day long to their work,\r\nseeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but Snowdrop was left at\r\nhome; and they warned her, and said, ‘The queen will soon find out where\r\nyou are, so take care and let no one in.’\r\n\r\nBut the queen, now that she thought Snowdrop was dead, believed that she\r\nmust be the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her glass and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n ‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!\r\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\r\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?’\r\n\r\nAnd the glass answered:\r\n\r\n ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:\r\n  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,\r\n  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,\r\n  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she\r\n  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.’\r\n\r\nThen the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass\r\nalways spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her.\r\nAnd she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful\r\nthan she was; so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar, and went\r\nher way over the hills, to the place where the dwarfs dwelt. Then she\r\nknocked at the door, and cried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’ Snowdrop looked\r\nout at the window, and said, ‘Good day, good woman! what have you to\r\nsell?’ ‘Good wares, fine wares,’ said she; ‘laces and bobbins of all\r\ncolours.’ ‘I will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good\r\nsort of body,’ thought Snowdrop, as she ran down and unbolted the door.\r\n‘Bless me!’ said the old woman, ‘how badly your stays are laced! Let me\r\nlace them up with one of my nice new laces.’ Snowdrop did not dream of\r\nany mischief; so she stood before the old woman; but she set to work\r\nso nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight, that Snowdrop’s breath was\r\nstopped, and she fell down as if she were dead. ‘There’s an end to all\r\nthy beauty,’ said the spiteful queen, and went away home.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how\r\ngrieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the\r\nground, as if she was quite dead. However, they lifted her up, and when\r\nthey found what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a little time she\r\nbegan to breathe, and very soon came to life again. Then they said, ‘The\r\nold woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one\r\nin when we are away.’\r\n\r\nWhen the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it\r\nas before; but to her great grief it still said:\r\n\r\n ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:\r\n  But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,\r\n  Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,\r\n  There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she\r\n  Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.’\r\n\r\nThen the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that\r\nSnowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite\r\nanother dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned\r\ncomb. When she reached the dwarfs’ cottage, she knocked at the door, and\r\ncried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’ But Snowdrop said, ‘I dare not let anyone\r\nin.’ Then the queen said, ‘Only look at my beautiful combs!’ and gave\r\nher the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty, that she took it up and\r\nput it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head,\r\nthe poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless. ‘There you may\r\nlie,’ said the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs\r\ncame in very early that evening; and when they saw Snowdrop lying on\r\nthe ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned\r\ncomb. And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that\r\nhad passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to\r\nanyone.\r\n\r\nMeantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she\r\nread the very same answer as before; and she said, ‘Snowdrop shall die,\r\nif it cost me my life.’ So she went by herself into her chamber, and got\r\nready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but\r\nwhoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a\r\npeasant’s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs’ cottage,\r\nand knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and\r\nsaid, ‘I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.’ ‘Do\r\nas you please,’ said the old woman, ‘but at any rate take this pretty\r\napple; I will give it you.’ ‘No,’ said Snowdrop, ‘I dare not take it.’\r\n‘You silly girl!’ answered the other, ‘what are you afraid of? Do you\r\nthink it is poisoned? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the\r\nother.’ Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the\r\nother side was poisoned. Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for\r\nthe apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she\r\ncould wait no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth,\r\nwhen she fell down dead upon the ground. ‘This time nothing will save\r\nthee,’ said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n ‘Thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair.’\r\n\r\nAnd then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nWhen evening came, and the dwarfs had gone home, they found Snowdrop\r\nlying on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were afraid\r\nthat she was quite dead. They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and\r\nwashed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little\r\ngirl seemed quite dead. So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven\r\nwatched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they\r\nwould bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just\r\nas it did while she was alive; so they said, ‘We will never bury her in\r\nthe cold ground.’ And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might\r\nstill look at her, and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name\r\nwas, and that she was a king’s daughter. And the coffin was set among\r\nthe hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the\r\nbirds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came\r\nan owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side.\r\n\r\nAnd thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as\r\nthough she was asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red\r\nas blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the\r\ndwarfs’ house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written in golden\r\nletters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them\r\nto let him take her away; but they said, ‘We will not part with her for\r\nall the gold in the world.’ At last, however, they had pity on him, and\r\ngave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home\r\nwith him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop\r\nawoke, and said, ‘Where am I?’ And the prince said, ‘Thou art quite safe\r\nwith me.’\r\n\r\nThen he told her all that had happened, and said, ‘I love you far better\r\nthan all the world; so come with me to my father’s palace, and you shall\r\nbe my wife.’ And Snowdrop consented, and went home with the prince;\r\nand everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their\r\nwedding.\r\n\r\nTo the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdrop’s old enemy the queen;\r\nand as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she looked in the\r\nglass and said:\r\n\r\n ‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!\r\n  Of all the ladies in the land,\r\n  Who is fairest, tell me, who?’\r\n\r\nAnd the glass answered:\r\n\r\n ‘Thou, lady, art loveliest here, I ween;\r\n  But lovelier far is the new-made queen.’\r\n\r\nWhen she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity\r\nwere so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride. And\r\nwhen she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as\r\nshe thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell\r\ndown and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily\r\nover that land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the\r\nmountains, and paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind\r\nto Snowdrop in her time of need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PINK\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children.\r\nEvery morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to\r\nbestow on her a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to her\r\nand said: ‘Be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of wishing,\r\nso that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have.’ Then\r\nshe went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time\r\nwas come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness.\r\n\r\nEvery morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild\r\nbeasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. It\r\nhappened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in\r\nher arms and she fell asleep. Then came the old cook, who knew that the\r\nchild had the power of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a hen,\r\nand cut it in pieces, and dropped some of its blood on the queen’s apron\r\nand on her dress. Then he carried the child away to a secret place,\r\nwhere a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and\r\naccused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by\r\nthe wild beasts. When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed\r\nthis, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built,\r\nin which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into\r\nit, and walled up. Here she was to stay for seven years without meat\r\nor drink, and die of hunger. But God sent two angels from heaven in the\r\nshape of white doves, which flew to her twice a day, and carried her\r\nfood until the seven years were over.\r\n\r\nThe cook, however, thought to himself: ‘If the child has the power of\r\nwishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.’ So\r\nhe left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to\r\nspeak, and said to him: ‘Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with\r\na garden, and all else that pertains to it.’ Scarcely were the words out\r\nof the boy’s mouth, when everything was there that he had wished for.\r\nAfter a while the cook said to him: ‘It is not well for you to be so\r\nalone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion.’ Then the king’s son\r\nwished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was more\r\nbeautiful than any painter could have painted her. The two played\r\ntogether, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook\r\nwent out hunting like a nobleman. The thought occurred to him, however,\r\nthat the king’s son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus\r\nbring him into great peril. So he went out and took the maiden aside,\r\nand said: ‘Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this\r\nknife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do\r\nnot do it, you shall lose your life.’ Thereupon he went away, and when\r\nhe returned next day she had not done it, and said: ‘Why should I shed\r\nthe blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed anyone?’ The cook once\r\nmore said: ‘If you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life.’ When\r\nhe had gone away, she had a little hind brought to her, and ordered her\r\nto be killed, and took her heart and tongue, and laid them on a plate,\r\nand when she saw the old man coming, she said to the boy: ‘Lie down in\r\nyour bed, and draw the clothes over you.’ Then the wicked wretch came in\r\nand said: ‘Where are the boy’s heart and tongue?’ The girl reached the\r\nplate to him, but the king’s son threw off the quilt, and said: ‘You old\r\nsinner, why did you want to kill me? Now will I pronounce thy sentence.\r\nYou shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck,\r\nand shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your\r\nthroat.’ And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed\r\ninto a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks\r\nwere ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the\r\nflames broke forth from his throat. The king’s son remained there a\r\nshort while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she\r\nwere still alive. At length he said to the maiden: ‘I will go home to my\r\nown country; if you will go with me, I will provide for you.’ ‘Ah,’\r\nshe replied, ‘the way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange land\r\nwhere I am unknown?’ As she did not seem quite willing, and as they\r\ncould not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be changed\r\ninto a beautiful pink, and took her with him. Then he went away to his\r\nown country, and the poodle had to run after him. He went to the tower\r\nin which his mother was confined, and as it was so high, he wished for\r\na ladder which would reach up to the very top. Then he mounted up and\r\nlooked inside, and cried: ‘Beloved mother, Lady Queen, are you still\r\nalive, or are you dead?’ She answered: ‘I have just eaten, and am still\r\nsatisfied,’ for she thought the angels were there. Said he: ‘I am your\r\ndear son, whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your arms;\r\nbut I am alive still, and will soon set you free.’ Then he descended\r\nagain, and went to his father, and caused himself to be announced as a\r\nstrange huntsman, and asked if he could offer him service. The king said\r\nyes, if he was skilful and could get game for him, he should come to\r\nhim, but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of the\r\ndistrict or country. Then the huntsman promised to procure as much game\r\nfor him as he could possibly use at the royal table. So he summoned all\r\nthe huntsmen together, and bade them go out into the forest with him.\r\nAnd he went with them and made them form a great circle, open at one end\r\nwhere he stationed himself, and began to wish. Two hundred deer and more\r\ncame running inside the circle at once, and the huntsmen shot them.\r\nThen they were all placed on sixty country carts, and driven home to the\r\nking, and for once he was able to deck his table with game, after having\r\nhad none at all for years.\r\n\r\nNow the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire\r\nhousehold should eat with him next day, and made a great feast. When\r\nthey were all assembled together, he said to the huntsman: ‘As you are\r\nso clever, you shall sit by me.’ He replied: ‘Lord King, your majesty\r\nmust excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.’ But the king insisted on it,\r\nand said: ‘You shall sit by me,’ until he did it. Whilst he was sitting\r\nthere, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the\r\nking’s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how\r\nit was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still,\r\nor had perished. Hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal began,\r\nand said: ‘Your majesty, we live joyously here, but how is the queen\r\nliving in the tower? Is she still alive, or has she died?’ But the king\r\nreplied: ‘She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will\r\nnot have her named.’ Then the huntsman arose and said: ‘Gracious lord\r\nfather she is alive still, and I am her son, and I was not carried away\r\nby wild beasts, but by that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her\r\narms when she was asleep, and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a\r\nchicken.’ Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar, and said:\r\n‘That is the wretch!’ and caused live coals to be brought, and these the\r\ndog was compelled to devour before the sight of all, until flames burst\r\nforth from its throat. On this the huntsman asked the king if he would\r\nlike to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into the form\r\nof the cook, in which he stood immediately, with his white apron,\r\nand his knife by his side. When the king saw him he fell into a passion,\r\nand ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon. Then the huntsman\r\nspoke further and said: ‘Father, will you see the maiden who brought me\r\nup so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me, but did not do it,\r\nthough her own life depended on it?’ The king replied: ‘Yes, I would\r\nlike to see her.’ The son said: ‘Most gracious father, I will show her\r\nto you in the form of a beautiful flower,’ and he thrust his hand into\r\nhis pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table,\r\nand it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.\r\nThen the son said: ‘Now will I show her to you in her own form,’ and\r\nwished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there looking so\r\nbeautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.\r\n\r\nAnd the king sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the tower,\r\nto fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. But when she was\r\nled in she ate nothing, and said: ‘The gracious and merciful God who has\r\nsupported me in the tower, will soon set me free.’ She lived three days\r\nmore, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white\r\ndoves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of\r\nheaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. The aged\r\nking ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the\r\nking’s own heart, and he soon died. His son married the beautiful maiden\r\nwhom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket, and whether they\r\nare still alive or not, is known to God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEVER ELSIE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And\r\nwhen she had grown up her father said: ‘We will get her married.’ ‘Yes,’\r\nsaid the mother, ‘if only someone would come who would have her.’ At\r\nlength a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans;\r\nbut he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. ‘Oh,’ said\r\nthe father, ‘she has plenty of good sense’; and the mother said: ‘Oh,\r\nshe can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.’\r\n‘Well,’ said Hans, ‘if she is not really smart, I won’t have her.’ When\r\nthey were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: ‘Elsie, go\r\ninto the cellar and fetch some beer.’ Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher\r\nfrom the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she\r\nwent, so that the time might not appear long. When she was below she\r\nfetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had\r\nno need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected\r\ninjury. Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and\r\nwhile the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but\r\nlooked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a\r\npick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThen Clever Elsie began to weep and said: ‘If I get Hans, and we have\r\na child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw\r\nbeer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then she\r\nsat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the\r\nmisfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs waited for the drink,\r\nbut Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the servant:\r\n‘Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.’ The maid went and\r\nfound her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly. ‘Elsie why\r\ndo you weep?’ asked the maid. ‘Ah,’ she answered, ‘have I not reason to\r\nweep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to\r\ndraw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill\r\nhim.’ Then said the maid: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down\r\nbeside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a while,\r\nas the maid did not come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the\r\nbeer, the man said to the boy: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see\r\nwhere Elsie and the girl are.’ The boy went down, and there sat Clever\r\nElsie and the girl both weeping together. Then he asked: ‘Why are you\r\nweeping?’ ‘Ah,’ said Elsie, ‘have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans,\r\nand we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the\r\npick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then said the boy: ‘What\r\na clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down by her, and likewise began to\r\nhowl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not\r\nreturn, the man said to the woman: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see\r\nwhere Elsie is!’ The woman went down, and found all three in the midst\r\nof their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told\r\nher also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it\r\ngrew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. Then said the\r\nmother likewise: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down and wept\r\nwith them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not\r\ncome back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: ‘I must go into the\r\ncellar myself and see where Elsie is.’ But when he got into the cellar,\r\nand they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and\r\nthat Elsie’s child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one\r\ninto the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if\r\nhe should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very\r\ntime when it fell down, he cried: ‘Oh, what a clever Elsie!’ and sat\r\ndown, and likewise wept with them. The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone\r\nfor a long time; then as no one would come back he thought: ‘They must be\r\nwaiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are about.’\r\nWhen he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting\r\nquite piteously, each out-doing the other. ‘What misfortune has happened\r\nthen?’ asked he. ‘Ah, dear Hans,’ said Elsie, ‘if we marry each other\r\nand have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw\r\nsomething to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might\r\ndash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to\r\nweep?’ ‘Come,’ said Hans, ‘more understanding than that is not needed\r\nfor my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,’ and\r\nseized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.\r\n\r\nAfter Hans had had her some time, he said: ‘Wife, I am going out to work\r\nand earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we\r\nmay have some bread.’ ‘Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.’ After Hans had\r\ngone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field\r\nwith her. When she came to the field she said to herself: ‘What shall I\r\ndo; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.’ Then\r\nshe drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once\r\nmore said: ‘What shall I do? Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first?\r\nI will sleep first.’ Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.\r\nHans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said\r\nhe: ‘What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not\r\neven come home to eat.’ But when evening came and she still stayed away,\r\nHans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she\r\nwas lying among the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought\r\na fowler’s net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she\r\nstill went on sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat\r\ndown in his chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever\r\nElsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about\r\nher, and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was\r\nalarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or\r\nnot, and said: ‘Is it I, or is it not I?’ But she knew not what answer\r\nto make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought:\r\n‘I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure\r\nto know.’ She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then\r\nshe knocked at the window and cried: ‘Hans, is Elsie within?’ ‘Yes,’\r\nanswered Hans, ‘she is within.’ Hereupon she was terrified, and said:\r\n‘Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,’ and went to another door; but when the\r\npeople heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she\r\ncould get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village, and no one has\r\nseen her since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MISER IN THE BUSH\r\n\r\n\r\nA farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for\r\nhim three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came\r\ninto the man’s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer;\r\nso he went to his master, and said, ‘I have worked hard for you a long\r\ntime, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my\r\ntrouble.’ The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very\r\nsimple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year’s\r\nservice a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to\r\nhave, and said to himself, ‘Why should I work hard, and live here on bad\r\nfare any longer? I can now travel into the wide world, and make myself\r\nmerry.’ With that he put his money into his purse, and set out, roaming\r\nover hill and valley.\r\n\r\nAs he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf\r\nmet him, and asked him what made him so merry. ‘Why, what should make\r\nme down-hearted?’ said he; ‘I am sound in health and rich in purse, what\r\nshould I care for? I have saved up my three years’ earnings and have it\r\nall safe in my pocket.’ ‘How much may it come to?’ said the little man.\r\n‘Full threepence,’ replied the countryman. ‘I wish you would give them\r\nto me,’ said the other; ‘I am very poor.’ Then the man pitied him, and\r\ngave him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return, ‘As you have\r\nsuch a kind honest heart, I will grant you three wishes--one for every\r\npenny; so choose whatever you like.’ Then the countryman rejoiced at\r\nhis good luck, and said, ‘I like many things better than money: first, I\r\nwill have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly,\r\na fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and\r\nthirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.’ The dwarf\r\nsaid he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle,\r\nand went his way.\r\n\r\nOur honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before,\r\nhe was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he met an old\r\nmiser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush\r\nsinging away most joyfully. ‘Oh, what a pretty bird!’ said the miser; ‘I\r\nwould give a great deal of money to have such a one.’ ‘If that’s all,’\r\nsaid the countryman, ‘I will soon bring it down.’ Then he took up his\r\nbow, and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree.\r\nThe miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into\r\nthe middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the\r\nmiser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in\r\nthe air. The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung\r\nin rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that\r\nthe blood ran down. ‘Oh, for heaven’s sake!’ cried the miser, ‘Master!\r\nmaster! pray let the fiddle alone. What have I done to deserve this?’\r\n‘Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough,’ said the other; ‘thou\r\nart only meeting thy reward’: so he played up another tune. Then the\r\nmiser began to beg and promise, and offered money for his liberty; but\r\nhe did not come up to the musician’s price for some time, and he danced\r\nhim along brisker and brisker, and the miser bid higher and higher, till\r\nat last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse,\r\nand had just gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countryman\r\nsaw so much money, he said, ‘I will agree to your proposal.’ So he took\r\nthe purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his\r\nbargain.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous\r\nplight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve\r\nhis late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge, and\r\ncomplained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him\r\ninto the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his\r\nback and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his\r\nofficers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he\r\nwas soon caught and brought up to be tried.\r\n\r\nThe miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of\r\nhis money. ‘No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.’ said the\r\ncountryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the\r\nmatter short by ordering him off to the gallows.\r\n\r\nSo away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, ‘My Lord\r\nJudge, grant me one last request.’ ‘Anything but thy life,’ replied the\r\nother. ‘No,’ said he, ‘I do not ask my life; only to let me play upon\r\nmy fiddle for the last time.’ The miser cried out, ‘Oh, no! no! for\r\nheaven’s sake don’t listen to him! don’t listen to him!’ But the judge\r\nsaid, ‘It is only this once, he will soon have done.’ The fact was, he\r\ncould not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf’s third gift.\r\n\r\nThen the miser said, ‘Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity’s sake.’ But\r\nthe countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first\r\nnote judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and\r\nno one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let his\r\nprisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first\r\nbar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and\r\nall the people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merry\r\nand pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed\r\nto be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him\r\nto leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties,\r\ntill the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him\r\nthe hundred florins.\r\n\r\nThen he called to the miser, and said, ‘Tell us now, you vagabond, where\r\nyou got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,’ ‘I stole\r\nit,’ said the miser in the presence of all the people; ‘I acknowledge\r\nthat I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.’ Then the countryman\r\nstopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASHPUTTEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew\r\nnigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, ‘Always be\r\na good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.’ Soon\r\nafterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden;\r\nand the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always\r\ngood and kind to all about her. And the snow fell and spread a beautiful\r\nwhite covering over the grave; but by the time the spring came, and the\r\nsun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife. This\r\nnew wife had two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her;\r\nthey were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time\r\nfor the poor little girl. ‘What does the good-for-nothing want in the\r\nparlour?’ said they; ‘they who would eat bread should first earn it;\r\naway with the kitchen-maid!’ Then they took away her fine clothes, and\r\ngave her an old grey frock to put on, and laughed at her, and turned her\r\ninto the kitchen.\r\n\r\nThere she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight, to\r\nbring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. Besides that,\r\nthe sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed at her. In the\r\nevening when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on, but was made\r\nto lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of course, made her\r\nalways dusty and dirty, they called her Ashputtel.\r\n\r\nIt happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his\r\nwife’s daughters what he should bring them. ‘Fine clothes,’ said the\r\nfirst; ‘Pearls and diamonds,’ cried the second. ‘Now, child,’ said he\r\nto his own daughter, ‘what will you have?’ ‘The first twig, dear\r\nfather, that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come\r\nhomewards,’ said she. Then he bought for the first two the fine clothes\r\nand pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he\r\nrode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against him, and almost\r\npushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he\r\ngot home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it, and went to\r\nher mother’s grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was\r\nwatered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree. Three\r\ntimes every day she went to it and cried; and soon a little bird came\r\nand built its nest upon the tree, and talked with her, and watched over\r\nher, and brought her whatever she wished for.\r\n\r\nNow it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to\r\nlast three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose\r\na bride for himself. Ashputtel’s two sisters were asked to come; so they\r\ncalled her up, and said, ‘Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie\r\nour sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king’s feast.’\r\nThen she did as she was told; but when all was done she could not help\r\ncrying, for she thought to herself, she should so have liked to have\r\ngone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard\r\nto let her go. ‘You, Ashputtel!’ said she; ‘you who have nothing to\r\nwear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance--you want to go to\r\nthe ball? And when she kept on begging, she said at last, to get rid of\r\nher, ‘I will throw this dishful of peas into the ash-heap, and if in\r\ntwo hours’ time you have picked them all out, you shall go to the feast\r\ntoo.’\r\n\r\nThen she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden ran\r\nout at the back door into the garden, and cried out:\r\n\r\n ‘Hither, hither, through the sky,\r\n  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!\r\n  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\r\n  Hither, hither, haste away!\r\n  One and all come help me, quick!\r\n  Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!’\r\n\r\nThen first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window; next\r\ncame two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under\r\nheaven, chirping and fluttering in: and they flew down into the ashes.\r\nAnd the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick,\r\npick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick: and among\r\nthem all they soon picked out all the good grain, and put it into a dish\r\nbut left the ashes. Long before the end of the hour the work was quite\r\ndone, and all flew out again at the windows.\r\n\r\nThen Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought\r\nthat now she should go to the ball. But the mother said, ‘No, no! you\r\nslut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go.’ And when\r\nAshputtel begged very hard to go, she said, ‘If you can in one hour’s\r\ntime pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes, you shall go\r\ntoo.’ And thus she thought she should at least get rid of her. So she\r\nshook two dishes of peas into the ashes.\r\n\r\nBut the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house,\r\nand cried out as before:\r\n\r\n ‘Hither, hither, through the sky,\r\n  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!\r\n  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,\r\n  Hither, hither, haste away!\r\n  One and all come help me, quick!\r\n  Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!’\r\n\r\nThen first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came two\r\nturtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven,\r\nchirping and hopping about. And they flew down into the ashes; and the\r\nlittle doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and\r\nthen the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put all the good grain\r\ninto the dishes, and left all the ashes. Before half an hour’s time all\r\nwas done, and out they flew again. And then Ashputtel took the dishes to\r\nher mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball.\r\nBut her mother said, ‘It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no\r\nclothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame’: and off\r\nshe went with her two daughters to the ball.\r\n\r\nNow when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went\r\nsorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:\r\n\r\n ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\r\n  Gold and silver over me!’\r\n\r\nThen her friend the bird flew out of the tree, and brought a gold and\r\nsilver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them\r\non, and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know her,\r\nand thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine and\r\nbeautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of Ashputtel,\r\ntaking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt.\r\n\r\nThe king’s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced\r\nwith her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when anyone\r\nelse came to ask her to dance, he said, ‘This lady is dancing with me.’\r\n\r\nThus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to\r\ngo home: and the king’s son said, ‘I shall go and take care of you to\r\nyour home’; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived. But\r\nshe slipped away from him, unawares, and ran off towards home; and as\r\nthe prince followed her, she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut\r\nthe door. Then he waited till her father came home, and told him that\r\nthe unknown maiden, who had been at the feast, had hid herself in the\r\npigeon-house. But when they had broken open the door they found no one\r\nwithin; and as they came back into the house, Ashputtel was lying, as\r\nshe always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little\r\nlamp was burning in the chimney. For she had run as quickly as she could\r\nthrough the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there taken\r\noff her beautiful clothes, and put them beneath the tree, that the bird\r\nmight carry them away, and had lain down again amid the ashes in her\r\nlittle grey frock.\r\n\r\nThe next day when the feast was again held, and her father, mother, and\r\nsisters were gone, Ashputtel went to the hazel-tree, and said:\r\n\r\n ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\r\n  Gold and silver over me!’\r\n\r\nAnd the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she\r\nhad worn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball, everyone\r\nwondered at her beauty: but the king’s son, who was waiting for her,\r\ntook her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone asked her to\r\ndance, he said as before, ‘This lady is dancing with me.’\r\n\r\nWhen night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son followed here\r\nas before, that he might see into what house she went: but she sprang\r\naway from him all at once into the garden behind her father’s house.\r\nIn this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and\r\nAshputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without\r\nbeing seen. Then the king’s son lost sight of her, and could not find\r\nout where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said\r\nto him, ‘The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I\r\nthink she must have sprung into the pear-tree.’ The father thought to\r\nhimself, ‘Can it be Ashputtel?’ So he had an axe brought; and they cut\r\ndown the tree, but found no one upon it. And when they came back into\r\nthe kitchen, there lay Ashputtel among the ashes; for she had slipped\r\ndown on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful clothes\r\nback to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on her little grey\r\nfrock.\r\n\r\nThe third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone, she\r\nwent again into the garden, and said:\r\n\r\n ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,\r\n  Gold and silver over me!’\r\n\r\nThen her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the\r\nformer one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she came\r\nto the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and the\r\nking’s son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked her to\r\ndance, he said, ‘This lady is _my_ partner, sir.’\r\n\r\nWhen night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son would go with\r\nher, and said to himself, ‘I will not lose her this time’; but, however,\r\nshe again slipped away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped\r\nher left golden slipper upon the stairs.\r\n\r\nThe prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his father,\r\nand said, ‘I will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipper\r\nfits.’ Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they\r\nhad beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden\r\nslipper. The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was, and\r\nwanted to try it on, and the mother stood by. But her great toe could\r\nnot go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her. Then\r\nthe mother gave her a knife, and said, ‘Never mind, cut it off; when you\r\nare queen you will not care about toes; you will not want to walk.’ So\r\nthe silly girl cut off her great toe, and thus squeezed on the shoe,\r\nand went to the king’s son. Then he took her for his bride, and set her\r\nbeside him on his horse, and rode away with her homewards.\r\n\r\nBut on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that Ashputtel\r\nhad planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:\r\n\r\n ‘Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\r\n  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!\r\n  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,\r\n  For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’\r\n\r\nThen the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the\r\nblood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him. So he\r\nturned his horse round, and brought the false bride back to her home,\r\nand said, ‘This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put\r\non the slipper.’ Then she went into the room and got her foot into the\r\nshoe, all but the heel, which was too large. But her mother squeezed it\r\nin till the blood came, and took her to the king’s son: and he set her\r\nas his bride by his side on his horse, and rode away with her.\r\n\r\nBut when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still,\r\nand sang:\r\n\r\n ‘Back again! back again! look to the shoe!\r\n  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!\r\n  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,\r\n  For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’\r\n\r\nThen he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the\r\nshoe, that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horse\r\nand brought her also back again. ‘This is not the true bride,’ said he\r\nto the father; ‘have you no other daughters?’ ‘No,’ said he; ‘there is\r\nonly a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am\r\nsure she cannot be the bride.’ The prince told him to send her. But the\r\nmother said, ‘No, no, she is much too dirty; she will not dare to show\r\nherself.’ However, the prince would have her come; and she first washed\r\nher face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and he reached\r\nher the golden slipper. Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot,\r\nand put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made\r\nfor her. And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and\r\nsaid, ‘This is the right bride.’ But the mother and both the sisters\r\nwere frightened, and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on his\r\nhorse, and rode away with her. And when they came to the hazel-tree, the\r\nwhite dove sang:\r\n\r\n ‘Home! home! look at the shoe!\r\n  Princess! the shoe was made for you!\r\n  Prince! prince! take home thy bride,\r\n  For she is the true one that sits by thy side!’\r\n\r\nAnd when the dove had done its song, it came flying, and perched upon\r\nher right shoulder, and so went home with her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE SNAKE\r\n\r\n\r\nA long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through\r\nall the land. Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of\r\nthe most secret things was brought to him through the air. But he had a\r\nstrange custom; every day after dinner, when the table was cleared,\r\nand no one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him one more\r\ndish. It was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what\r\nwas in it, neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the\r\ncover to eat of it until he was quite alone.\r\n\r\nThis had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took\r\naway the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help\r\ncarrying the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked the door,\r\nhe lifted up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish. But\r\nwhen he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it,\r\nso he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth. No sooner had it\r\ntouched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices\r\noutside his window. He went and listened, and then noticed that it was\r\nthe sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one another of\r\nall kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods. Eating\r\nthe snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals.\r\n\r\nNow it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most\r\nbeautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty\r\nservant, who was allowed to go everywhere. The king ordered the man to\r\nbe brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he\r\ncould before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked\r\nupon as guilty and executed. In vain he declared his innocence; he was\r\ndismissed with no better answer.\r\n\r\nIn his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought\r\nhow to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks were sitting\r\ntogether quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they\r\nwere making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a\r\nconfidential conversation together. The servant stood by and listened.\r\nThey were telling one another of all the places where they had been\r\nwaddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and\r\none said in a pitiful tone: ‘Something lies heavy on my stomach; as\r\nI was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen’s\r\nwindow.’ The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the\r\nkitchen, and said to the cook: ‘Here is a fine duck; pray, kill her.’\r\n‘Yes,’ said the cook, and weighed her in his hand; ‘she has spared\r\nno trouble to fatten herself, and has been waiting to be roasted long\r\nenough.’ So he cut off her head, and as she was being dressed for the\r\nspit, the queen’s ring was found inside her.\r\n\r\nThe servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make\r\namends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him\r\nthe best place in the court that he could wish for. The servant refused\r\neverything, and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling, as\r\nhe had a mind to see the world and go about a little. When his request\r\nwas granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he\r\nsaw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water. Now, though\r\nit is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must\r\nperish so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart, he got off his\r\nhorse and put the three prisoners back into the water. They leapt with\r\ndelight, put out their heads, and cried to him: ‘We will remember you\r\nand repay you for saving us!’\r\n\r\nHe rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in\r\nthe sand at his feet. He listened, and heard an ant-king complain: ‘Why\r\ncannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies? That stupid\r\nhorse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without\r\nmercy!’ So he turned on to a side path and the ant-king cried out to\r\nhim: ‘We will remember you--one good turn deserves another!’\r\n\r\nThe path led him into a wood, and there he saw two old ravens standing\r\nby their nest, and throwing out their young ones. ‘Out with you, you\r\nidle, good-for-nothing creatures!’ cried they; ‘we cannot find food for\r\nyou any longer; you are big enough, and can provide for yourselves.’\r\nBut the poor young ravens lay upon the ground, flapping their wings, and\r\ncrying: ‘Oh, what helpless chicks we are! We must shift for ourselves,\r\nand yet we cannot fly! What can we do, but lie here and starve?’ So the\r\ngood young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword, and gave\r\nit to them for food. Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their\r\nhunger, and cried: ‘We will remember you--one good turn deserves\r\nanother!’\r\n\r\nAnd now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a long\r\nway, he came to a large city. There was a great noise and crowd in\r\nthe streets, and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud: ‘The king’s\r\ndaughter wants a husband; but whoever seeks her hand must perform a hard\r\ntask, and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life.’ Many had\r\nalready made the attempt, but in vain; nevertheless when the youth\r\nsaw the king’s daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he\r\nforgot all danger, went before the king, and declared himself a suitor.\r\n\r\nSo he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it, before\r\nhis eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the\r\nbottom of the sea, and added: ‘If you come up again without it you will\r\nbe thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves.’ All the\r\npeople grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him\r\nalone by the sea.\r\n\r\nHe stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly\r\nhe saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they were the very\r\nfishes whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel in\r\nits mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth’s feet, and when he\r\nhad taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell.\r\nFull of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him\r\nthe promised reward.\r\n\r\nBut when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in\r\nbirth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another\r\ntask. She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten\r\nsacksful of millet-seed on the grass; then she said: ‘Tomorrow morning\r\nbefore sunrise these must be picked up, and not a single grain be\r\nwanting.’\r\n\r\nThe youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible\r\nto perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he sat\r\nsorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death.\r\nBut as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw\r\nall the ten sacks standing side by side, quite full, and not a single\r\ngrain was missing. The ant-king had come in the night with thousands\r\nand thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had by great industry\r\npicked up all the millet-seed and gathered them into the sacks.\r\n\r\nPresently the king’s daughter herself came down into the garden, and was\r\namazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him.\r\nBut she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said: ‘Although he\r\nhas performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband until he had\r\nbrought me an apple from the Tree of Life.’ The youth did not know where\r\nthe Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and would have gone on for ever,\r\nas long as his legs would carry him, though he had no hope of finding\r\nit. After he had wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to\r\na wood, and lay down under a tree to sleep. But he heard a rustling in\r\nthe branches, and a golden apple fell into his hand. At the same time\r\nthree ravens flew down to him, perched themselves upon his knee, and\r\nsaid: ‘We are the three young ravens whom you saved from starving; when\r\nwe had grown big, and heard that you were seeking the Golden Apple,\r\nwe flew over the sea to the end of the world, where the Tree of Life\r\nstands, and have brought you the apple.’ The youth, full of joy, set out\r\nhomewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king’s beautiful daughter,\r\nwho had now no more excuses left to make. They cut the Apple of Life in\r\ntwo and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him,\r\nand they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOLF AND THE SEVEN LITTLE KIDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and\r\nloved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she\r\nwanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all\r\nseven to her and said: ‘Dear children, I have to go into the forest,\r\nbe on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you\r\nall--skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often disguises himself, but\r\nyou will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.’ The\r\nkids said: ‘Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go\r\naway without any anxiety.’ Then the old one bleated, and went on her way\r\nwith an easy mind.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called:\r\n‘Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought\r\nsomething back with her for each of you.’ But the little kids knew that\r\nit was the wolf, by the rough voice. ‘We will not open the door,’ cried\r\nthey, ‘you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but\r\nyour voice is rough; you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf went away to a\r\nshopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made\r\nhis voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the\r\nhouse, and called: ‘Open the door, dear children, your mother is here\r\nand has brought something back with her for each of you.’ But the wolf\r\nhad laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them\r\nand cried: ‘We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet\r\nlike you: you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf ran to a baker and said: ‘I\r\nhave hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.’ And when the baker\r\nhad rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said: ‘Strew some\r\nwhite meal over my feet for me.’ The miller thought to himself: ‘The\r\nwolf wants to deceive someone,’ and refused; but the wolf said: ‘If you\r\nwill not do it, I will devour you.’ Then the miller was afraid, and made\r\nhis paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of mankind.\r\n\r\nSo now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at\r\nit and said: ‘Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother\r\nhas come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the\r\nforest with her.’ The little kids cried: ‘First show us your paws that\r\nwe may know if you are our dear little mother.’ Then he put his paws\r\nin through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they\r\nbelieved that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should\r\ncome in but the wolf! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.\r\nOne sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the\r\nstove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the\r\nsixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But\r\nthe wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the\r\nother he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest, who was in\r\nthe clock-case, was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had\r\nsatisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a\r\ntree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep. Soon afterwards\r\nthe old goat came home again from the forest. Ah! what a sight she saw\r\nthere! The house-door stood wide open. The table, chairs, and benches\r\nwere thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts\r\nand pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her children, but they\r\nwere nowhere to be found. She called them one after another by name, but\r\nno one answered. At last, when she came to the youngest, a soft voice\r\ncried: ‘Dear mother, I am in the clock-case.’ She took the kid out, and\r\nit told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Then\r\nyou may imagine how she wept over her poor children.\r\n\r\nAt length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her.\r\nWhen they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored\r\nso loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side and\r\nsaw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly. ‘Ah,\r\nheavens,’ she said, ‘is it possible that my poor children whom he has\r\nswallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?’ Then the kid had to\r\nrun home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the goat cut\r\nopen the monster’s stomach, and hardly had she made one cut, than one\r\nlittle kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six\r\nsprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered\r\nno injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them\r\ndown whole. What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother,\r\nand jumped like a tailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said: ‘Now\r\ngo and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast’s\r\nstomach with them while he is still asleep.’ Then the seven kids dragged\r\nthe stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into this\r\nstomach as they could get in; and the mother sewed him up again in the\r\ngreatest haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once\r\nstirred.\r\n\r\nWhen the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs,\r\nand as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to\r\ngo to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about, the\r\nstones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried\r\nhe:\r\n\r\n ‘What rumbles and tumbles\r\n  Against my poor bones?\r\n  I thought ‘twas six kids,\r\n  But it feels like big stones.’\r\n\r\nAnd when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the\r\nheavy stones made him fall in, and he drowned miserably. When the seven\r\nkids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: ‘The wolf\r\nis dead! The wolf is dead!’ and danced for joy round about the well with\r\ntheir mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUEEN BEE\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo kings’ sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their\r\nfortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so\r\nthat they could not return home again. Then their brother, who was a\r\nlittle insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when\r\nhe had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who was so\r\nyoung and simple, should try to travel through the world, when they, who\r\nwere so much wiser, had been unable to get on. However, they all set\r\nout on their journey together, and came at last to an ant-hill. The two\r\nelder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor\r\nants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs. But the\r\nlittle dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, I will not\r\nsuffer you to trouble them.’\r\n\r\nSo on they went, and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimming\r\nabout. The two brothers wanted to catch two, and roast them. But the\r\ndwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, you shall not kill\r\nthem.’ Next they came to a bees’-nest in a hollow tree, and there was\r\nso much honey that it ran down the trunk; and the two brothers wanted to\r\nlight a fire under the tree and kill the bees, so as to get their honey.\r\nBut the dwarf held them back, and said, ‘Let the pretty insects enjoy\r\nthemselves, I cannot let you burn them.’\r\n\r\nAt length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed by the\r\nstables they saw fine horses standing there, but all were of marble, and\r\nno man was to be seen. Then they went through all the rooms, till they\r\ncame to a door on which were three locks: but in the middle of the door\r\nwas a wicket, so that they could look into the next room. There they saw\r\na little grey old man sitting at a table; and they called to him once or\r\ntwice, but he did not hear: however, they called a third time, and then\r\nhe rose and came out to them.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful\r\ntable covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten and\r\ndrunk, he showed each of them to a bed-chamber.\r\n\r\nThe next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble table,\r\nwhere there were three tablets, containing an account of the means by\r\nwhich the castle might be disenchanted. The first tablet said: ‘In the\r\nwood, under the moss, lie the thousand pearls belonging to the king’s\r\ndaughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing by set of sun,\r\nhe who seeks them will be turned into marble.’\r\n\r\nThe eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day:\r\nbut the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he was\r\nturned into stone as the tablet had foretold.\r\n\r\nThe next day the second brother undertook the task; but he succeeded no\r\nbetter than the first; for he could only find the second hundred of the\r\npearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone.\r\n\r\nAt last came the little dwarf’s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it\r\nwas so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!--so he sat\r\ndown upon a stone and cried. And as he sat there, the king of the ants\r\n(whose life he had saved) came to help him, with five thousand ants; and\r\nit was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in a\r\nheap.\r\n\r\nThe second tablet said: ‘The key of the princess’s bed-chamber must be\r\nfished up out of the lake.’ And as the dwarf came to the brink of it,\r\nhe saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they\r\ndived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.\r\n\r\nThe third task was the hardest. It was to choose out the youngest and\r\nthe best of the king’s three daughters. Now they were all beautiful, and\r\nall exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece of\r\nsugar, the next some sweet syrup, and the youngest a spoonful of honey;\r\nso he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey.\r\n\r\nThen came the queen of the bees, who had been saved by the little dwarf\r\nfrom the fire, and she tried the lips of all three; but at last she sat\r\nupon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the dwarf knew\r\nwhich was the youngest. Thus the spell was broken, and all who had been\r\nturned into stones awoke, and took their proper forms. And the dwarf\r\nmarried the youngest and the best of the princesses, and was king after\r\nher father’s death; but his two brothers married the other two sisters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest:\r\nbut still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he\r\nhad in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\nThen he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning\r\nto rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear and\r\nhis heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed,\r\nleft all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the morning after\r\nhe had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his\r\ngreat wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table. The\r\ngood man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening.\r\nHe looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the\r\nwhole job; all was so neat and true, that it was quite a masterpiece.\r\n\r\nThe same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that\r\nhe willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor\r\nshoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs more.\r\nIn the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might\r\nget up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for\r\nwhen he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soon\r\nin came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought\r\nleather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight\r\nand found it done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some\r\ntime: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and\r\nthe good man soon became thriving and well off again.\r\n\r\nOne evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over\r\nthe fire chatting together, he said to her, ‘I should like to sit up and\r\nwatch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for\r\nme.’ The wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning, and hid\r\nthemselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up\r\nthere, and watched what would happen.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and\r\nthey sat themselves upon the shoemaker’s bench, took up all the work\r\nthat was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching\r\nand rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all\r\nwonder, and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went, till the\r\njob was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table.\r\nThis was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nThe next day the wife said to the shoemaker. ‘These little wights have\r\nmade us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good\r\nturn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and\r\nindeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to\r\nkeep off the cold. I’ll tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt,\r\nand a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and\r\ndo you make each of them a little pair of shoes.’\r\n\r\nThe thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when\r\nall the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the\r\nwork that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to\r\nwatch what the little elves would do.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the\r\nroom, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they\r\nsaw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed\r\nmightily delighted.\r\n\r\nThen they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and\r\ncapered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced\r\nout at the door, and away over the green.\r\n\r\nThe good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them\r\nfrom that time forward, as long as they lived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JUNIPER-TREE\r\n\r\n\r\nLong, long ago, some two thousand years or so, there lived a rich\r\nman with a good and beautiful wife. They loved each other dearly, but\r\nsorrowed much that they had no children. So greatly did they desire\r\nto have one, that the wife prayed for it day and night, but still they\r\nremained childless.\r\n\r\nIn front of the house there was a court, in which grew a juniper-tree.\r\nOne winter’s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples, and\r\nas she was peeling them, she cut her finger, and the blood fell on the\r\nsnow. ‘Ah,’ sighed the woman heavily, ‘if I had but a child, as red as\r\nblood and as white as snow,’ and as she spoke the words, her heart grew\r\nlight within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and\r\nshe returned to the house feeling glad and comforted. A month passed,\r\nand the snow had all disappeared; then another month went by, and all\r\nthe earth was green. So the months followed one another, and first the\r\ntrees budded in the woods, and soon the green branches grew thickly\r\nintertwined, and then the blossoms began to fall. Once again the wife\r\nstood under the juniper-tree, and it was so full of sweet scent that her\r\nheart leaped for joy, and she was so overcome with her happiness, that\r\nshe fell on her knees. Presently the fruit became round and firm, and\r\nshe was glad and at peace; but when they were fully ripe she picked the\r\nberries and ate eagerly of them, and then she grew sad and ill. A little\r\nwhile later she called her husband, and said to him, weeping. ‘If I\r\ndie, bury me under the juniper-tree.’ Then she felt comforted and happy\r\nagain, and before another month had passed she had a little child, and\r\nwhen she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood, her joy\r\nwas so great that she died.\r\n\r\nHer husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for\r\nher. By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he\r\nstill grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later\r\non he married again.\r\n\r\nHe now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife\r\nwas a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow. The mother\r\nloved her daughter very much, and when she looked at her and then looked\r\nat the boy, it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in\r\nthe way of her own child, and she was continually thinking how she could\r\nget the whole of the property for her. This evil thought took possession\r\nof her more and more, and made her behave very unkindly to the boy. She\r\ndrove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings, so that the\r\npoor child went about in fear, and had no peace from the time he left\r\nschool to the time he went back.\r\n\r\nOne day the little daughter came running to her mother in the\r\nstore-room, and said, ‘Mother, give me an apple.’ ‘Yes, my child,’ said\r\nthe wife, and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; the chest\r\nhad a very heavy lid and a large iron lock.\r\n\r\n‘Mother,’ said the little daughter again, ‘may not brother have one\r\ntoo?’ The mother was angry at this, but she answered, ‘Yes, when he\r\ncomes out of school.’\r\n\r\nJust then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and it seemed\r\nas if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the apple out\r\nof her little daughter’s hand, and said, ‘You shall not have one before\r\nyour brother.’ She threw the apple into the chest and shut it to. The\r\nlittle boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife made her say\r\nkindly to him, ‘My son, will you have an apple?’ but she gave him a\r\nwicked look. ‘Mother,’ said the boy, ‘how dreadful you look! Yes, give\r\nme an apple.’ The thought came to her that she would kill him. ‘Come\r\nwith me,’ she said, and she lifted up the lid of the chest; ‘take one\r\nout for yourself.’ And as he bent over to do so, the evil spirit urged\r\nher, and crash! down went the lid, and off went the little boy’s head.\r\nThen she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought of what she had done.\r\n‘If only I can prevent anyone knowing that I did it,’ she thought. So\r\nshe went upstairs to her room, and took a white handkerchief out of\r\nher top drawer; then she set the boy’s head again on his shoulders, and\r\nbound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and placed\r\nhim on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirring\r\na pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, ‘Mother, brother is\r\nsitting by the door with an apple in his hand, and he looks so pale;\r\nand when I asked him to give me the apple, he did not answer, and that\r\nfrightened me.’\r\n\r\n‘Go to him again,’ said her mother, ‘and if he does not answer, give him\r\na box on the ear.’ So little Marleen went, and said, ‘Brother, give me\r\nthat apple,’ but he did not say a word; then she gave him a box on the\r\near, and his head rolled off. She was so terrified at this, that she ran\r\ncrying and screaming to her mother. ‘Oh!’ she said, ‘I have knocked off\r\nbrother’s head,’ and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her.\r\n\r\n‘What have you done!’ said her mother, ‘but no one must know about it,\r\nso you must keep silence; what is done can’t be undone; we will make\r\nhim into puddings.’ And she took the little boy and cut him up, made him\r\ninto puddings, and put him in the pot. But Marleen stood looking on,\r\nand wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no\r\nneed of salt.\r\n\r\nPresently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked,\r\n‘Where is my son?’ The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of\r\nblack pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing.\r\n\r\nThe father again asked, ‘Where is my son?’\r\n\r\n‘Oh,’ answered the wife, ‘he is gone into the country to his mother’s\r\ngreat uncle; he is going to stay there some time.’\r\n\r\n‘What has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to me!’\r\n\r\n‘Well, he likes being there, and he told me he should be away quite six\r\nweeks; he is well looked after there.’\r\n\r\n‘I feel very unhappy about it,’ said the husband, ‘in case it should not\r\nbe all right, and he ought to have said goodbye to me.’\r\n\r\nWith this he went on with his dinner, and said, ‘Little Marleen, why do\r\nyou weep? Brother will soon be back.’ Then he asked his wife for more\r\npudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the table.\r\n\r\nLittle Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of\r\nher bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the\r\ntable and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but\r\nweep. Then she laid them in the green grass under the juniper-tree, and\r\nshe had no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to leave her,\r\nand she wept no more. And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the\r\nbranches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and\r\nthen together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for\r\njoy. After this a mist came round the tree, and in the midst of it there\r\nwas a burning as of fire, and out of the fire there flew a beautiful\r\nbird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, and when it\r\ncould no more be seen, the juniper-tree stood there as before, and the\r\nsilk handkerchief and the bones were gone.\r\n\r\nLittle Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were\r\nstill alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to\r\nthe table and ate.\r\n\r\nThe bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began to\r\nsing:\r\n\r\n ‘My mother killed her little son;\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n  And took my bones that they might lie\r\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\r\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r\n\r\nThe goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain, when he heard the\r\nsong of the bird on his roof. He thought it so beautiful that he got\r\nup and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his\r\nslippers. But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on\r\none foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still\r\nheld the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing\r\nup at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.\r\n\r\n‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing! Sing me that song again.’\r\n\r\n‘Nay,’ said the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing. Give that gold\r\nchain, and I will sing it you again.’\r\n\r\n‘Here is the chain, take it,’ said the goldsmith. ‘Only sing me that\r\nagain.’\r\n\r\nThe bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw, and then\r\nhe alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang:\r\n\r\n ‘My mother killed her little son;\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n  And took my bones that they might lie\r\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\r\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r\n\r\nThen he flew away, and settled on the roof of a shoemaker’s house and\r\nsang:\r\n\r\n ‘My mother killed her little son;\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n  And took my bones that they might lie\r\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\r\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r\n\r\nThe shoemaker heard him, and he jumped up and ran out in his\r\nshirt-sleeves, and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his\r\nhand over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun.\r\n\r\n‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing!’ Then he called through the\r\ndoor to his wife: ‘Wife, come out; here is a bird, come and look at it\r\nand hear how beautifully it sings.’ Then he called his daughter and the\r\nchildren, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the\r\nstreet to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red\r\nand green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two\r\nbright stars in its head.\r\n\r\n‘Bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘sing me that song again.’\r\n\r\n‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; you must\r\ngive me something.’\r\n\r\n‘Wife,’ said the man, ‘go into the garret; on the upper shelf you will\r\nsee a pair of red shoes; bring them to me.’ The wife went in and fetched\r\nthe shoes.\r\n\r\n‘There, bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘now sing me that song again.’\r\n\r\nThe bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then he\r\nwent back to the roof and sang:\r\n\r\n ‘My mother killed her little son;\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n  And took my bones that they might lie\r\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\r\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished, he flew away. He had the chain in his right claw\r\nand the shoes in his left, and he flew right away to a mill, and the\r\nmill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click clack.’ Inside the mill were\r\ntwenty of the miller’s men hewing a stone, and as they went ‘Hick hack,\r\nhick hack, hick hack,’ the mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click\r\nclack.’\r\n\r\nThe bird settled on a lime-tree in front of the mill and sang:\r\n\r\n ‘My mother killed her little son;\r\n\r\nthen one of the men left off,\r\n\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n\r\ntwo more men left off and listened,\r\n\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n\r\nthen four more left off,\r\n\r\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n  And took my bones that they might lie\r\n\r\nnow there were only eight at work,\r\n\r\n  Underneath\r\n\r\nAnd now only five,\r\n\r\n  the juniper-tree.\r\n\r\nAnd now only one,\r\n\r\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r\n\r\nthen he looked up and the last one had left off work.\r\n\r\n‘Bird,’ he said, ‘what a beautiful song that is you sing! Let me hear it\r\ntoo; sing it again.’\r\n\r\n‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; give me that\r\nmillstone, and I will sing it again.’\r\n\r\n‘If it belonged to me alone,’ said the man, ‘you should have it.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, yes,’ said the others: ‘if he will sing again, he can have it.’\r\n\r\nThe bird came down, and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up the\r\nstone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole and took\r\nthe stone round his neck like a collar, and flew back with it to the\r\ntree and sang--\r\n\r\n ‘My mother killed her little son;\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n  And took my bones that they might lie\r\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\r\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r\n\r\nAnd when he had finished his song, he spread his wings, and with the\r\nchain in his right claw, the shoes in his left, and the millstone round\r\nhis neck, he flew right away to his father’s house.\r\n\r\nThe father, the mother, and little Marleen were having their dinner.\r\n\r\n‘How lighthearted I feel,’ said the father, ‘so pleased and cheerful.’\r\n\r\n‘And I,’ said the mother, ‘I feel so uneasy, as if a heavy thunderstorm\r\nwere coming.’\r\n\r\nBut little Marleen sat and wept and wept.\r\n\r\nThen the bird came flying towards the house and settled on the roof.\r\n\r\n‘I do feel so happy,’ said the father, ‘and how beautifully the sun\r\nshines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.’\r\n\r\n‘Ah!’ said the wife, ‘and I am so full of distress and uneasiness that\r\nmy teeth chatter, and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins,’ and\r\nshe tore open her dress; and all the while little Marleen sat in the\r\ncorner and wept, and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears.\r\n\r\nThe bird now flew to the juniper-tree and began singing:\r\n\r\n ‘My mother killed her little son;\r\n\r\nthe mother shut her eyes and her ears, that she might see and hear\r\nnothing, but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of a\r\nviolent storm, and in her eyes a burning and flashing like lightning:\r\n\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n\r\n‘Look, mother,’ said the man, ‘at the beautiful bird that is singing so\r\nmagnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious\r\nscent of spice in the air!’\r\n\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n\r\nthen little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed.\r\n\r\n‘I must go outside and see the bird nearer,’ said the man.\r\n\r\n‘Ah, do not go!’ cried the wife. ‘I feel as if the whole house were in\r\nflames!’\r\n\r\nBut the man went out and looked at the bird.\r\n\r\n She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n And took my bones that they might lie\r\n Underneath the juniper-tree\r\n Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r\n\r\nWith that the bird let fall the gold chain, and it fell just round the\r\nman’s neck, so that it fitted him exactly.\r\n\r\nHe went inside, and said, ‘See, what a splendid bird that is; he has\r\ngiven me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself.’\r\n\r\nBut the wife was in such fear and trouble, that she fell on the floor,\r\nand her cap fell from her head.\r\n\r\nThen the bird began again:\r\n\r\n ‘My mother killed her little son;\r\n\r\n‘Ah me!’ cried the wife, ‘if I were but a thousand feet beneath the\r\nearth, that I might not hear that song.’\r\n\r\n  My father grieved when I was gone;\r\n\r\nthen the woman fell down again as if dead.\r\n\r\n  My sister loved me best of all;\r\n\r\n‘Well,’ said little Marleen, ‘I will go out too and see if the bird will\r\ngive me anything.’\r\n\r\nSo she went out.\r\n\r\n  She laid her kerchief over me,\r\n  And took my bones that they might lie\r\n\r\nand he threw down the shoes to her,\r\n\r\n  Underneath the juniper-tree\r\n  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’\r\n\r\nAnd she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and\r\ndanced and jumped about in them. ‘I was so miserable,’ she said, ‘when I\r\ncame out, but that has all passed away; that is indeed a splendid bird,\r\nand he has given me a pair of red shoes.’\r\n\r\nThe wife sprang up, with her hair standing out from her head like flames\r\nof fire. ‘Then I will go out too,’ she said, ‘and see if it will lighten\r\nmy misery, for I feel as if the world were coming to an end.’\r\n\r\nBut as she crossed the threshold, crash! the bird threw the millstone\r\ndown on her head, and she was crushed to death.\r\n\r\nThe father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they only\r\nsaw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these had\r\npassed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and\r\nlittle Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went\r\ninside together and sat down to their dinners and ate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TURNIP\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich and\r\nthe other poor. The poor man thought he would try to better himself; so,\r\npulling off his red coat, he became a gardener, and dug his ground well,\r\nand sowed turnips.\r\n\r\nWhen the seed came up, there was one plant bigger than all the rest; and\r\nit kept getting larger and larger, and seemed as if it would never cease\r\ngrowing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for\r\nthere never was such a one seen before, and never will again. At last it\r\nwas so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly draw it; and\r\nthe gardener knew not what in the world to do with it, nor whether it\r\nwould be a blessing or a curse to him. One day he said to himself, ‘What\r\nshall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another;\r\nand for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing\r\nperhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.’\r\n\r\nThen he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave it\r\nto the king. ‘What a wonderful thing!’ said the king; ‘I have seen many\r\nstrange things, but such a monster as this I never saw. Where did you\r\nget the seed? or is it only your good luck? If so, you are a true child\r\nof fortune.’ ‘Ah, no!’ answered the gardener, ‘I am no child of fortune;\r\nI am a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so I\r\nlaid aside my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground. I have a\r\nbrother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world\r\nknows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me.’\r\n\r\nThe king then took pity on him, and said, ‘You shall be poor no\r\nlonger. I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your\r\nbrother.’ Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so\r\nrich that his brother’s fortune could not at all be compared with his.\r\n\r\nWhen the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the\r\ngardener so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he\r\ncould contrive to get the same good fortune for himself. However, he\r\ndetermined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together a\r\nrich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must\r\nhave a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so\r\nmuch for only a turnip, what must his present be worth?\r\n\r\nThe king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to\r\ngive in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so\r\nthe soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him.\r\nWhen he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite;\r\nand at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to\r\nkill his brother.\r\n\r\nSo he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to\r\nlie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, ‘Dear brother, I have\r\nfound a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between\r\nus.’ The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out\r\ntogether, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed out\r\nupon him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree.\r\n\r\nBut whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a\r\nhorse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their\r\nprisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a\r\ncord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away. Meantime\r\nhe worked and worked away, till he made a hole large enough to put out\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nWhen the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow,\r\nwho was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went. As soon as\r\nthe man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out, ‘Good\r\nmorning! good morning to thee, my friend!’ The student looked about\r\neverywhere; and seeing no one, and not knowing where the voice came\r\nfrom, cried out, ‘Who calls me?’\r\n\r\nThen the man in the tree answered, ‘Lift up thine eyes, for behold here\r\nI sit in the sack of wisdom; here have I, in a short time, learned great\r\nand wondrous things. Compared to this seat, all the learning of the\r\nschools is as empty air. A little longer, and I shall know all that man\r\ncan know, and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind. Here\r\nI discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws\r\nthat control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the\r\nhealing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of\r\nprecious stones. Wert thou but once here, my friend, though wouldst feel\r\nand own the power of knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said,\r\n‘Blessed be the day and hour when I found you; cannot you contrive to\r\nlet me into the sack for a little while?’ Then the other answered, as if\r\nvery unwillingly, ‘A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou\r\nwilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an\r\nhour below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown\r\nto me.’\r\n\r\nSo the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung\r\nheavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith,\r\nfor his thirst for knowledge was great. Then the other pretended to give\r\nway, and said, ‘Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend, by untying\r\nyonder cord, and then thou shalt enter.’ So the student let him down,\r\nopened the sack, and set him free. ‘Now then,’ cried he, ‘let me ascend\r\nquickly.’ As he began to put himself into the sack heels first, ‘Wait a\r\nwhile,’ said the gardener, ‘that is not the way.’ Then he pushed him\r\nin head first, tied up the sack, and soon swung up the searcher after\r\nwisdom dangling in the air. ‘How is it with thee, friend?’ said he,\r\n‘dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee? Rest there in peace,\r\ntill thou art a wiser man than thou wert.’\r\n\r\nSo saying, he trotted off on the student’s nag, and left the poor fellow\r\nto gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEVER HANS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mother of Hans said: ‘Whither away, Hans?’ Hans answered: ‘To\r\nGretel.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh, I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’\r\n‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day,\r\nHans. What do you bring that is good?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want to have\r\nsomething given me.’ Gretel presents Hans with a needle, Hans says:\r\n‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’\r\n\r\nHans takes the needle, sticks it into a hay-cart, and follows the cart\r\nhome. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’\r\n‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘Took nothing; had something\r\ngiven me.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a needle.’ ‘Where is the\r\nneedle, Hans?’ ‘Stuck in the hay-cart.’ ‘That was ill done, Hans. You\r\nshould have stuck the needle in your sleeve.’ ‘Never mind, I’ll do\r\nbetter next time.’\r\n\r\n‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,\r\nI’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to\r\nGretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What do you bring that is\r\ngood?’ ‘I bring nothing. I want to have something given to me.’ Gretel\r\npresents Hans with a knife. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans\r\ntakes the knife, sticks it in his sleeve, and goes home. ‘Good evening,\r\nmother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ What\r\ndid you take her?’ ‘Took her nothing, she gave me something.’ ‘What did\r\nGretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a knife.’ ‘Where is the knife, Hans?’ ‘Stuck\r\nin my sleeve.’ ‘That’s ill done, Hans, you should have put the knife in\r\nyour pocket.’ ‘Never mind, will do better next time.’\r\n\r\n‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,\r\nI’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to\r\nGretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good thing do you\r\nbring?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want something given me.’ Gretel presents\r\nHans with a young goat. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans takes\r\nthe goat, ties its legs, and puts it in his pocket. When he gets home it\r\nis suffocated. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have\r\nyou been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘Took nothing, she\r\ngave me something.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘She gave me a goat.’\r\n‘Where is the goat, Hans?’ ‘Put it in my pocket.’ ‘That was ill done,\r\nHans, you should have put a rope round the goat’s neck.’ ‘Never mind,\r\nwill do better next time.’\r\n\r\n‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,\r\nI’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to\r\nGretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good thing do you\r\nbring?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want something given me.’ Gretel presents\r\nHans with a piece of bacon. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’\r\n\r\nHans takes the bacon, ties it to a rope, and drags it away behind him.\r\nThe dogs come and devour the bacon. When he gets home, he has the rope\r\nin his hand, and there is no longer anything hanging on to it. ‘Good\r\nevening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With\r\nGretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘I took her nothing, she gave me\r\nsomething.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a bit of bacon.’ ‘Where\r\nis the bacon, Hans?’ ‘I tied it to a rope, brought it home, dogs took\r\nit.’ ‘That was ill done, Hans, you should have carried the bacon on your\r\nhead.’ ‘Never mind, will do better next time.’\r\n\r\n‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘I’ll\r\nbehave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to Gretel.\r\n‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans, What good thing do you bring?’ ‘I\r\nbring nothing, but would have something given.’ Gretel presents Hans\r\nwith a calf. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’\r\n\r\nHans takes the calf, puts it on his head, and the calf kicks his face.\r\n‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With\r\nGretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘I took nothing, but had something\r\ngiven me.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘A calf.’ ‘Where have you the\r\ncalf, Hans?’ ‘I set it on my head and it kicked my face.’ ‘That was\r\nill done, Hans, you should have led the calf, and put it in the stall.’\r\n‘Never mind, will do better next time.’\r\n\r\n‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘I’ll\r\nbehave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’\r\n\r\nHans comes to Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good\r\nthing do you bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, but would have something given.’\r\nGretel says to Hans: ‘I will go with you.’\r\n\r\nHans takes Gretel, ties her to a rope, leads her to the rack, and binds\r\nher fast. Then Hans goes to his mother. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good\r\nevening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take\r\nher?’ ‘I took her nothing.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘She gave me\r\nnothing, she came with me.’ ‘Where have you left Gretel?’ ‘I led her by\r\nthe rope, tied her to the rack, and scattered some grass for her.’ ‘That\r\nwas ill done, Hans, you should have cast friendly eyes on her.’ ‘Never\r\nmind, will do better.’\r\n\r\nHans went into the stable, cut out all the calves’ and sheep’s eyes,\r\nand threw them in Gretel’s face. Then Gretel became angry, tore herself\r\nloose and ran away, and was no longer the bride of Hans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THREE LANGUAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nAn aged count once lived in Switzerland, who had an only son, but he\r\nwas stupid, and could learn nothing. Then said the father: ‘Hark you,\r\nmy son, try as I will I can get nothing into your head. You must go from\r\nhence, I will give you into the care of a celebrated master, who shall\r\nsee what he can do with you.’ The youth was sent into a strange town,\r\nand remained a whole year with the master. At the end of this time,\r\nhe came home again, and his father asked: ‘Now, my son, what have you\r\nlearnt?’ ‘Father, I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark.’ ‘Lord\r\nhave mercy on us!’ cried the father; ‘is that all you have learnt? I\r\nwill send you into another town, to another master.’ The youth was taken\r\nthither, and stayed a year with this master likewise. When he came back\r\nthe father again asked: ‘My son, what have you learnt?’ He answered:\r\n‘Father, I have learnt what the birds say.’ Then the father fell into a\r\nrage and said: ‘Oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and\r\nlearnt nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes? I will\r\nsend you to a third master, but if you learn nothing this time also, I\r\nwill no longer be your father.’ The youth remained a whole year with the\r\nthird master also, and when he came home again, and his father inquired:\r\n‘My son, what have you learnt?’ he answered: ‘Dear father, I have this\r\nyear learnt what the frogs croak.’ Then the father fell into the most\r\nfurious anger, sprang up, called his people thither, and said: ‘This man\r\nis no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him\r\nout into the forest, and kill him.’ They took him forth, but when they\r\nshould have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go,\r\nand they cut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carry\r\nthem to the old man as a token.\r\n\r\nThe youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he\r\nbegged for a night’s lodging. ‘Yes,’ said the lord of the castle, ‘if\r\nyou will pass the night down there in the old tower, go thither; but I\r\nwarn you, it is at the peril of your life, for it is full of wild dogs,\r\nwhich bark and howl without stopping, and at certain hours a man has to\r\nbe given to them, whom they at once devour.’ The whole district was in\r\nsorrow and dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything to\r\nstop this. The youth, however, was without fear, and said: ‘Just let me\r\ngo down to the barking dogs, and give me something that I can throw to\r\nthem; they will do nothing to harm me.’ As he himself would have it so,\r\nthey gave him some food for the wild animals, and led him down to the\r\ntower. When he went inside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged\r\ntheir tails quite amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and\r\ndid not hurt one hair of his head. Next morning, to the astonishment of\r\neveryone, he came out again safe and unharmed, and said to the lord of\r\nthe castle: ‘The dogs have revealed to me, in their own language, why\r\nthey dwell there, and bring evil on the land. They are bewitched, and\r\nare obliged to watch over a great treasure which is below in the tower,\r\nand they can have no rest until it is taken away, and I have likewise\r\nlearnt, from their discourse, how that is to be done.’ Then all who\r\nheard this rejoiced, and the lord of the castle said he would adopt him\r\nas a son if he accomplished it successfully. He went down again, and\r\nas he knew what he had to do, he did it thoroughly, and brought a chest\r\nfull of gold out with him. The howling of the wild dogs was henceforth\r\nheard no more; they had disappeared, and the country was freed from the\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nAfter some time he took it in his head that he would travel to Rome. On\r\nthe way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of frogs were sitting\r\ncroaking. He listened to them, and when he became aware of what they\r\nwere saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad. At last he arrived in\r\nRome, where the Pope had just died, and there was great doubt among\r\nthe cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his successor. They at\r\nlength agreed that the person should be chosen as pope who should be\r\ndistinguished by some divine and miraculous token. And just as that was\r\ndecided on, the young count entered into the church, and suddenly two\r\nsnow-white doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting there. The\r\necclesiastics recognized therein the token from above, and asked him on\r\nthe spot if he would be pope. He was undecided, and knew not if he were\r\nworthy of this, but the doves counselled him to do it, and at length he\r\nsaid yes. Then was he anointed and consecrated, and thus was fulfilled\r\nwhat he had heard from the frogs on his way, which had so affected him,\r\nthat he was to be his Holiness the Pope. Then he had to sing a mass, and\r\ndid not know one word of it, but the two doves sat continually on his\r\nshoulders, and said it all in his ear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOX AND THE CAT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to\r\nherself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the\r\nworld,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,\r\nhow are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard\r\ntimes?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from\r\nhead to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give\r\nany answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you\r\npiebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have\r\nyou the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How\r\nmany arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the\r\ncat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are\r\nfollowing me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’\r\nsaid the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain\r\na sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will\r\nteach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter\r\nwith four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top\r\nof it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your\r\nsack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had\r\nalready seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the\r\ncat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been\r\nable to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOUR CLEVER BROTHERS\r\n\r\n\r\n‘Dear children,’ said a poor man to his four sons, ‘I have nothing to\r\ngive you; you must go out into the wide world and try your luck. Begin\r\nby learning some craft or another, and see how you can get on.’ So the\r\nfour brothers took their walking-sticks in their hands, and their little\r\nbundles on their shoulders, and after bidding their father goodbye, went\r\nall out at the gate together. When they had got on some way they came\r\nto four crossways, each leading to a different country. Then the eldest\r\nsaid, ‘Here we must part; but this day four years we will come back\r\nto this spot, and in the meantime each must try what he can do for\r\nhimself.’\r\n\r\nSo each brother went his way; and as the eldest was hastening on a man\r\nmet him, and asked him where he was going, and what he wanted. ‘I am\r\ngoing to try my luck in the world, and should like to begin by learning\r\nsome art or trade,’ answered he. ‘Then,’ said the man, ‘go with me, and\r\nI will teach you to become the cunningest thief that ever was.’ ‘No,’\r\nsaid the other, ‘that is not an honest calling, and what can one look\r\nto earn by it in the end but the gallows?’ ‘Oh!’ said the man, ‘you need\r\nnot fear the gallows; for I will only teach you to steal what will be\r\nfair game: I meddle with nothing but what no one else can get or care\r\nanything about, and where no one can find you out.’ So the young man\r\nagreed to follow his trade, and he soon showed himself so clever, that\r\nnothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon.\r\n\r\nThe second brother also met a man, who, when he found out what he was\r\nsetting out upon, asked him what craft he meant to follow. ‘I do not\r\nknow yet,’ said he. ‘Then come with me, and be a star-gazer. It is a\r\nnoble art, for nothing can be hidden from you, when once you understand\r\nthe stars.’ The plan pleased him much, and he soon became such a skilful\r\nstar-gazer, that when he had served out his time, and wanted to leave\r\nhis master, he gave him a glass, and said, ‘With this you can see all\r\nthat is passing in the sky and on earth, and nothing can be hidden from\r\nyou.’\r\n\r\nThe third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught him\r\nso well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very clever in the\r\ncraft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow, and\r\nsaid, ‘Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.’\r\n\r\nThe youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to\r\ndo. ‘Would not you like,’ said he, ‘to be a tailor?’ ‘Oh, no!’ said\r\nthe young man; ‘sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working\r\nbackwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.’\r\n‘Oh!’ answered the man, ‘that is not my sort of tailoring; come with me,\r\nand you will learn quite another kind of craft from that.’ Not knowing\r\nwhat better to do, he came into the plan, and learnt tailoring from the\r\nbeginning; and when he left his master, he gave him a needle, and said,\r\n‘You can sew anything with this, be it as soft as an egg or as hard as\r\nsteel; and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen.’\r\n\r\nAfter the space of four years, at the time agreed upon, the four\r\nbrothers met at the four cross-roads; and having welcomed each other,\r\nset off towards their father’s home, where they told him all that had\r\nhappened to them, and how each had learned some craft.\r\n\r\nThen, one day, as they were sitting before the house under a very high\r\ntree, the father said, ‘I should like to try what each of you can do in\r\nthis way.’ So he looked up, and said to the second son, ‘At the top of\r\nthis tree there is a chaffinch’s nest; tell me how many eggs there are\r\nin it.’ The star-gazer took his glass, looked up, and said, ‘Five.’\r\n‘Now,’ said the father to the eldest son, ‘take away the eggs without\r\nletting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them know\r\nanything of what you are doing.’ So the cunning thief climbed up the\r\ntree, and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the bird;\r\nand it never saw or felt what he was doing, but kept sitting on at its\r\nease. Then the father took the eggs, and put one on each corner of the\r\ntable, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman, ‘Cut all\r\nthe eggs in two pieces at one shot.’ The huntsman took up his bow, and\r\nat one shot struck all the five eggs as his father wished.\r\n\r\n‘Now comes your turn,’ said he to the young tailor; ‘sew the eggs and\r\nthe young birds in them together again, so neatly that the shot shall\r\nhave done them no harm.’ Then the tailor took his needle, and sewed the\r\neggs as he was told; and when he had done, the thief was sent to take\r\nthem back to the nest, and put them under the bird without its knowing\r\nit. Then she went on sitting, and hatched them: and in a few days they\r\ncrawled out, and had only a little red streak across their necks, where\r\nthe tailor had sewn them together.\r\n\r\n‘Well done, sons!’ said the old man; ‘you have made good use of your\r\ntime, and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not\r\nknow which ought to have the prize. Oh, that a time might soon come for\r\nyou to turn your skill to some account!’\r\n\r\nNot long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the\r\nking’s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the king\r\nmourned over his loss day and night, and made it known that whoever\r\nbrought her back to him should have her for a wife. Then the four\r\nbrothers said to each other, ‘Here is a chance for us; let us try\r\nwhat we can do.’ And they agreed to see whether they could not set the\r\nprincess free. ‘I will soon find out where she is, however,’ said the\r\nstar-gazer, as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried out, ‘I\r\nsee her afar off, sitting upon a rock in the sea, and I can spy the\r\ndragon close by, guarding her.’ Then he went to the king, and asked for\r\na ship for himself and his brothers; and they sailed together over the\r\nsea, till they came to the right place. There they found the princess\r\nsitting, as the star-gazer had said, on the rock; and the dragon was\r\nlying asleep, with his head upon her lap. ‘I dare not shoot at him,’\r\nsaid the huntsman, ‘for I should kill the beautiful young lady also.’\r\n‘Then I will try my skill,’ said the thief, and went and stole her away\r\nfrom under the dragon, so quietly and gently that the beast did not know\r\nit, but went on snoring.\r\n\r\nThen away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the\r\nship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for\r\nhe awoke and missed the princess. But when he got over the boat, and\r\nwanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess, the huntsman took\r\nup his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down\r\ndead. They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in\r\nhis fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea\r\nupon a few planks. So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large\r\nstitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these,\r\nand sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked\r\nthem together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then\r\nreached the ship and got home safe.\r\n\r\nWhen they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great\r\nrejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, ‘One of you shall marry\r\nher, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.’ Then\r\nthere arose a quarrel between them; and the star-gazer said, ‘If I had\r\nnot found the princess out, all your skill would have been of no use;\r\ntherefore she ought to be mine.’ ‘Your seeing her would have been of\r\nno use,’ said the thief, ‘if I had not taken her away from the dragon;\r\ntherefore she ought to be mine.’ ‘No, she is mine,’ said the huntsman;\r\n‘for if I had not killed the dragon, he would, after all, have torn you\r\nand the princess into pieces.’ ‘And if I had not sewn the boat together\r\nagain,’ said the tailor, ‘you would all have been drowned, therefore she\r\nis mine.’ Then the king put in a word, and said, ‘Each of you is right;\r\nand as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of\r\nyou to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great\r\ndeal better. But to make up for your loss, I will give each of you, as a\r\nreward for his skill, half a kingdom.’ So the brothers agreed that this\r\nplan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who\r\nhad no mind to have them. And the king then gave to each half a kingdom,\r\nas he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and\r\ntook good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the\r\nyoung lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have\r\nher again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLILY AND THE LION\r\n\r\n\r\nA merchant, who had three daughters, was once setting out upon a\r\njourney; but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he should\r\nbring back for her. The eldest wished for pearls; the second for jewels;\r\nbut the third, who was called Lily, said, ‘Dear father, bring me a\r\nrose.’ Now it was no easy task to find a rose, for it was the middle\r\nof winter; yet as she was his prettiest daughter, and was very fond of\r\nflowers, her father said he would try what he could do. So he kissed all\r\nthree, and bid them goodbye.\r\n\r\nAnd when the time came for him to go home, he had bought pearls and\r\njewels for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for the\r\nrose; and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing, the\r\npeople laughed at him, and asked him whether he thought roses grew in\r\nsnow. This grieved him very much, for Lily was his dearest child; and as\r\nhe was journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he came to a\r\nfine castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half of which it\r\nseemed to be summer-time and in the other half winter. On one side the\r\nfinest flowers were in full bloom, and on the other everything looked\r\ndreary and buried in the snow. ‘A lucky hit!’ said he, as he called to\r\nhis servant, and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was\r\nthere, and bring him away one of the finest flowers.\r\n\r\nThis done, they were riding away well pleased, when up sprang a fierce\r\nlion, and roared out, ‘Whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten up\r\nalive!’ Then the man said, ‘I knew not that the garden belonged to you;\r\ncan nothing save my life?’ ‘No!’ said the lion, ‘nothing, unless you\r\nundertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home; if you\r\nagree to this, I will give you your life, and the rose too for your\r\ndaughter.’ But the man was unwilling to do so and said, ‘It may be my\r\nyoungest daughter, who loves me most, and always runs to meet me when\r\nI go home.’ Then the servant was greatly frightened, and said, ‘It may\r\nperhaps be only a cat or a dog.’ And at last the man yielded with a\r\nheavy heart, and took the rose; and said he would give the lion whatever\r\nshould meet him first on his return.\r\n\r\nAnd as he came near home, it was Lily, his youngest and dearest\r\ndaughter, that met him; she came running, and kissed him, and welcomed\r\nhim home; and when she saw that he had brought her the rose, she was\r\nstill more glad. But her father began to be very sorrowful, and to weep,\r\nsaying, ‘Alas, my dearest child! I have bought this flower at a high\r\nprice, for I have said I would give you to a wild lion; and when he has\r\nyou, he will tear you in pieces, and eat you.’ Then he told her all that\r\nhad happened, and said she should not go, let what would happen.\r\n\r\nBut she comforted him, and said, ‘Dear father, the word you have given\r\nmust be kept; I will go to the lion, and soothe him: perhaps he will let\r\nme come safe home again.’\r\n\r\nThe next morning she asked the way she was to go, and took leave of her\r\nfather, and went forth with a bold heart into the wood. But the lion was\r\nan enchanted prince. By day he and all his court were lions, but in the\r\nevening they took their right forms again. And when Lily came to the\r\ncastle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him. The\r\nwedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time. The\r\nprince was only to be seen as soon as evening came, and then he held his\r\ncourt; but every morning he left his bride, and went away by himself,\r\nshe knew not whither, till the night came again.\r\n\r\nAfter some time he said to her, ‘Tomorrow there will be a great feast in\r\nyour father’s house, for your eldest sister is to be married; and if\r\nyou wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither.’ Then she\r\nrejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set\r\nout with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had\r\nthought her dead long since. But she told them how happy she was, and\r\nstayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood.\r\n\r\nHer second sister was soon after married, and when Lily was asked to\r\ngo to the wedding, she said to the prince, ‘I will not go alone this\r\ntime--you must go with me.’ But he would not, and said that it would be\r\na very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch-light should\r\nfall upon him his enchantment would become still worse, for he should be\r\nchanged into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world for seven\r\nlong years. However, she gave him no rest, and said she would take care\r\nno light should fall upon him. So at last they set out together, and\r\ntook with them their little child; and she chose a large hall with thick\r\nwalls for him to sit in while the wedding-torches were lighted; but,\r\nunluckily, no one saw that there was a crack in the door. Then the\r\nwedding was held with great pomp, but as the train came from the church,\r\nand passed with the torches before the hall, a very small ray of light\r\nfell upon the prince. In a moment he disappeared, and when his wife came\r\nin and looked for him, she found only a white dove; and it said to her,\r\n‘Seven years must I fly up and down over the face of the earth, but\r\nevery now and then I will let fall a white feather, that will show you\r\nthe way I am going; follow it, and at last you may overtake and set me\r\nfree.’\r\n\r\nThis said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every\r\nnow and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to\r\njourney. Thus she went roving on through the wide world, and looked\r\nneither to the right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for seven\r\nyears. Then she began to be glad, and thought to herself that the time\r\nwas fast coming when all her troubles should end; yet repose was still\r\nfar off, for one day as she was travelling on she missed the white\r\nfeather, and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove.\r\n‘Now,’ thought she to herself, ‘no aid of man can be of use to me.’ So\r\nshe went to the sun and said, ‘Thou shinest everywhere, on the hill’s\r\ntop and the valley’s depth--hast thou anywhere seen my white dove?’\r\n‘No,’ said the sun, ‘I have not seen it; but I will give thee a\r\ncasket--open it when thy hour of need comes.’\r\n\r\nSo she thanked the sun, and went on her way till eventide; and when\r\nthe moon arose, she cried unto it, and said, ‘Thou shinest through the\r\nnight, over field and grove--hast thou nowhere seen my white dove?’\r\n‘No,’ said the moon, ‘I cannot help thee but I will give thee an\r\negg--break it when need comes.’\r\n\r\nThen she thanked the moon, and went on till the night-wind blew; and she\r\nraised up her voice to it, and said, ‘Thou blowest through every tree\r\nand under every leaf--hast thou not seen my white dove?’ ‘No,’ said the\r\nnight-wind, ‘but I will ask three other winds; perhaps they have seen\r\nit.’ Then the east wind and the west wind came, and said they too had\r\nnot seen it, but the south wind said, ‘I have seen the white dove--he\r\nhas fled to the Red Sea, and is changed once more into a lion, for the\r\nseven years are passed away, and there he is fighting with a dragon;\r\nand the dragon is an enchanted princess, who seeks to separate him from\r\nyou.’ Then the night-wind said, ‘I will give thee counsel. Go to the\r\nRed Sea; on the right shore stand many rods--count them, and when thou\r\ncomest to the eleventh, break it off, and smite the dragon with it; and\r\nso the lion will have the victory, and both of them will appear to you\r\nin their own forms. Then look round and thou wilt see a griffin, winged\r\nlike bird, sitting by the Red Sea; jump on to his back with thy beloved\r\none as quickly as possible, and he will carry you over the waters to\r\nyour home. I will also give thee this nut,’ continued the night-wind.\r\n‘When you are half-way over, throw it down, and out of the waters will\r\nimmediately spring up a high nut-tree on which the griffin will be able\r\nto rest, otherwise he would not have the strength to bear you the whole\r\nway; if, therefore, thou dost forget to throw down the nut, he will let\r\nyou both fall into the sea.’\r\n\r\nSo our poor wanderer went forth, and found all as the night-wind had\r\nsaid; and she plucked the eleventh rod, and smote the dragon, and the\r\nlion forthwith became a prince, and the dragon a princess again. But\r\nno sooner was the princess released from the spell, than she seized\r\nthe prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffin’s back, and went off\r\ncarrying the prince away with her.\r\n\r\nThus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she\r\ntook heart and said, ‘As far as the wind blows, and so long as the cock\r\ncrows, I will journey on, till I find him once again.’ She went on for\r\na long, long way, till at length she came to the castle whither the\r\nprincess had carried the prince; and there was a feast got ready, and\r\nshe heard that the wedding was about to be held. ‘Heaven aid me now!’\r\nsaid she; and she took the casket that the sun had given her, and found\r\nthat within it lay a dress as dazzling as the sun itself. So she put it\r\non, and went into the palace, and all the people gazed upon her; and\r\nthe dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether it was to be\r\nsold. ‘Not for gold and silver.’ said she, ‘but for flesh and blood.’\r\nThe princess asked what she meant, and she said, ‘Let me speak with the\r\nbridegroom this night in his chamber, and I will give thee the dress.’\r\nAt last the princess agreed, but she told her chamberlain to give the\r\nprince a sleeping draught, that he might not hear or see her. When\r\nevening came, and the prince had fallen asleep, she was led into\r\nhis chamber, and she sat herself down at his feet, and said: ‘I have\r\nfollowed thee seven years. I have been to the sun, the moon, and the\r\nnight-wind, to seek thee, and at last I have helped thee to overcome\r\nthe dragon. Wilt thou then forget me quite?’ But the prince all the time\r\nslept so soundly, that her voice only passed over him, and seemed like\r\nthe whistling of the wind among the fir-trees.\r\n\r\nThen poor Lily was led away, and forced to give up the golden dress; and\r\nwhen she saw that there was no help for her, she went out into a meadow,\r\nand sat herself down and wept. But as she sat she bethought herself of\r\nthe egg that the moon had given her; and when she broke it, there ran\r\nout a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold, that played about, and then\r\nnestled under the old one’s wings, so as to form the most beautiful\r\nsight in the world. And she rose up and drove them before her, till the\r\nbride saw them from her window, and was so pleased that she came forth\r\nand asked her if she would sell the brood. ‘Not for gold or silver, but\r\nfor flesh and blood: let me again this evening speak with the bridegroom\r\nin his chamber, and I will give thee the whole brood.’\r\n\r\nThen the princess thought to betray her as before, and agreed to\r\nwhat she asked: but when the prince went to his chamber he asked\r\nthe chamberlain why the wind had whistled so in the night. And the\r\nchamberlain told him all--how he had given him a sleeping draught, and\r\nhow a poor maiden had come and spoken to him in his chamber, and was\r\nto come again that night. Then the prince took care to throw away the\r\nsleeping draught; and when Lily came and began again to tell him what\r\nwoes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him she had been,\r\nhe knew his beloved wife’s voice, and sprang up, and said, ‘You have\r\nawakened me as from a dream, for the strange princess had thrown a spell\r\naround me, so that I had altogether forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent\r\nyou to me in a lucky hour.’\r\n\r\nAnd they stole away out of the palace by night unawares, and seated\r\nthemselves on the griffin, who flew back with them over the Red Sea.\r\nWhen they were half-way across Lily let the nut fall into the water,\r\nand immediately a large nut-tree arose from the sea, whereon the griffin\r\nrested for a while, and then carried them safely home. There they found\r\ntheir child, now grown up to be comely and fair; and after all their\r\ntroubles they lived happily together to the end of their days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOX AND THE HORSE\r\n\r\n\r\nA farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to\r\nhim: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him\r\nnothing more to eat, and said, ‘I want you no longer, so take yourself\r\noff out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are\r\nstronger than a lion.’ Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.\r\n\r\nThe poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the\r\nwood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently\r\na fox met him: ‘What’s the matter, my friend?’ said he, ‘why do you hang\r\ndown your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?’ ‘Ah!’ replied the\r\nhorse, ‘justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has\r\nforgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I\r\ncan no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become\r\nstronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I\r\nhave of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so.’\r\n\r\nHowever, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, ‘I will help you;\r\nlie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be\r\ndead.’ The horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the\r\nlion who lived in a cave close by, and said to him, ‘A little way off\r\nlies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent meal of\r\nhis carcase.’ The lion was greatly pleased, and set off immediately; and\r\nwhen they came to the horse, the fox said, ‘You will not be able to eat\r\nhim comfortably here; I’ll tell you what--I will tie you fast to\r\nhis tail, and then you can draw him to your den, and eat him at your\r\nleisure.’\r\n\r\nThis advice pleased the lion, so he laid himself down quietly for the\r\nfox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs\r\ntogether and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he\r\ncould not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped the\r\nhorse on the shoulder, and said, ‘Jip! Dobbin! Jip!’ Then up he sprang,\r\nand moved off, dragging the lion behind him. The beast began to roar\r\nand bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the\r\nhorse let him sing on, and made his way quietly over the fields to his\r\nmaster’s house.\r\n\r\n‘Here he is, master,’ said he, ‘I have got the better of him’: and when\r\nthe farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said. ‘Thou\r\nshalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.’ And so the poor old\r\nhorse had plenty to eat, and lived--till he died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLUE LIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the\r\nking faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer\r\nbecause of the many wounds which he had received. The king said to him:\r\n‘You may return to your home, I need you no longer, and you will not\r\nreceive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me\r\nservice for them.’ Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living,\r\nwent away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the\r\nevening he entered a forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light,\r\nwhich he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. ‘Do give\r\nme one night’s lodging, and a little to eat and drink,’ said he to\r\nher, ‘or I shall starve.’ ‘Oho!’ she answered, ‘who gives anything to a\r\nrun-away soldier? Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you\r\nwill do what I wish.’ ‘What do you wish?’ said the soldier. ‘That you\r\nshould dig all round my garden for me, tomorrow.’ The soldier consented,\r\nand next day laboured with all his strength, but could not finish it by\r\nthe evening. ‘I see well enough,’ said the witch, ‘that you can do no\r\nmore today, but I will keep you yet another night, in payment for\r\nwhich you must tomorrow chop me a load of wood, and chop it small.’ The\r\nsoldier spent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the witch\r\nproposed that he should stay one night more. ‘Tomorrow, you shall only\r\ndo me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my house, there is an old\r\ndry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns blue, and never goes\r\nout, and you shall bring it up again.’ Next day the old woman took him\r\nto the well, and let him down in a basket. He found the blue light, and\r\nmade her a signal to draw him up again. She did draw him up, but when he\r\ncame near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the\r\nblue light away from him. ‘No,’ said he, perceiving her evil intention,\r\n‘I will not give you the light until I am standing with both feet upon\r\nthe ground.’ The witch fell into a passion, let him fall again into the\r\nwell, and went away.\r\n\r\nThe poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue\r\nlight went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw very well\r\nthat he could not escape death. He sat for a while very sorrowfully,\r\nthen suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which\r\nwas still half full. ‘This shall be my last pleasure,’ thought he,\r\npulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to smoke. When the\r\nsmoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood\r\nbefore him, and said: ‘Lord, what are your commands?’ ‘What my commands\r\nare?’ replied the soldier, quite astonished. ‘I must do everything you\r\nbid me,’ said the little man. ‘Good,’ said the soldier; ‘then in the\r\nfirst place help me out of this well.’ The little man took him by the\r\nhand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget\r\nto take the blue light with him. On the way the dwarf showed him the\r\ntreasures which the witch had collected and hidden there, and the\r\nsoldier took as much gold as he could carry. When he was above, he said\r\nto the little man: ‘Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before\r\nthe judge.’ In a short time she came by like the wind, riding on a wild\r\ntom-cat and screaming frightfully. Nor was it long before the little man\r\nreappeared. ‘It is all done,’ said he, ‘and the witch is already hanging\r\non the gallows. What further commands has my lord?’ inquired the dwarf.\r\n‘At this moment, none,’ answered the soldier; ‘you can return home, only\r\nbe at hand immediately, if I summon you.’ ‘Nothing more is needed than\r\nthat you should light your pipe at the blue light, and I will appear\r\nbefore you at once.’ Thereupon he vanished from his sight.\r\n\r\nThe soldier returned to the town from which he came. He went to the\r\nbest inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord\r\nfurnish him a room as handsome as possible. When it was ready and the\r\nsoldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin\r\nand said: ‘I have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me,\r\nand left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.’ ‘What am I to\r\ndo?’ asked the little man. ‘Late at night, when the king’s daughter is\r\nin bed, bring her here in her sleep, she shall do servant’s work for\r\nme.’ The manikin said: ‘That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very\r\ndangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.’\r\nWhen twelve o’clock had struck, the door sprang open, and the manikin\r\ncarried in the princess. ‘Aha! are you there?’ cried the soldier, ‘get\r\nto your work at once! Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.’ When\r\nshe had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he\r\nstretched out his feet and said: ‘Pull off my boots,’ and then he\r\nthrew them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean\r\nand brighten them. She, however, did everything he bade her, without\r\nopposition, silently and with half-shut eyes. When the first cock\r\ncrowed, the manikin carried her back to the royal palace, and laid her\r\nin her bed.\r\n\r\nNext morning when the princess arose she went to her father, and told\r\nhim that she had had a very strange dream. ‘I was carried through the\r\nstreets with the rapidity of lightning,’ said she, ‘and taken into a\r\nsoldier’s room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his\r\nroom, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a\r\ndream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.’\r\n‘The dream may have been true,’ said the king. ‘I will give you a piece\r\nof advice. Fill your pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in the\r\npocket, and then if you are carried away again, they will fall out and\r\nleave a track in the streets.’ But unseen by the king, the manikin was\r\nstanding beside him when he said that, and heard all. At night when\r\nthe sleeping princess was again carried through the streets, some peas\r\ncertainly did fall out of her pocket, but they made no track, for the\r\ncrafty manikin had just before scattered peas in every street there\r\nwas. And again the princess was compelled to do servant’s work until\r\ncock-crow.\r\n\r\nNext morning the king sent his people out to seek the track, but it was\r\nall in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up\r\npeas, and saying: ‘It must have rained peas, last night.’ ‘We must think\r\nof something else,’ said the king; ‘keep your shoes on when you go to\r\nbed, and before you come back from the place where you are taken, hide\r\none of them there, I will soon contrive to find it.’ The black manikin\r\nheard this plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to\r\nbring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no\r\nexpedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found\r\nin the soldier’s house it would go badly with him. ‘Do what I bid you,’\r\nreplied the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged\r\nto work like a servant, but before she went away, she hid her shoe under\r\nthe bed.\r\n\r\nNext morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughter’s\r\nshoe. It was found at the soldier’s, and the soldier himself, who at the\r\nentreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back,\r\nand thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable\r\nthings he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in\r\nhis pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of\r\nhis dungeon, when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. The\r\nsoldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up, said to\r\nhim: ‘Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in\r\nthe inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.’ His comrade ran\r\nthither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone\r\nagain, he lighted his pipe and summoned the black manikin. ‘Have no\r\nfear,’ said the latter to his master. ‘Go wheresoever they take you, and\r\nlet them do what they will, only take the blue light with you.’ Next day\r\nthe soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge\r\ncondemned him to death. When he was led forth to die, he begged a last\r\nfavour of the king. ‘What is it?’ asked the king. ‘That I may smoke one\r\nmore pipe on my way.’ ‘You may smoke three,’ answered the king, ‘but do\r\nnot imagine that I will spare your life.’ Then the soldier pulled out\r\nhis pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths\r\nof smoke had ascended, the manikin was there with a small cudgel in his\r\nhand, and said: ‘What does my lord command?’ ‘Strike down to earth that\r\nfalse judge there, and his constable, and spare not the king who has\r\ntreated me so ill.’ Then the manikin fell on them like lightning,\r\ndarting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by\r\nhis cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again. The king\r\nwas terrified; he threw himself on the soldier’s mercy, and merely to\r\nbe allowed to live at all, gave him his kingdom for his own, and his\r\ndaughter to wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAVEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run\r\nalone. One day the child was very troublesome, and the mother could not\r\nquiet it, do what she would. She grew impatient, and seeing the ravens\r\nflying round the castle, she opened the window, and said: ‘I wish you\r\nwere a raven and would fly away, then I should have a little peace.’\r\nScarcely were the words out of her mouth, when the child in her arms was\r\nturned into a raven, and flew away from her through the open window. The\r\nbird took its flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long time,\r\nand meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their child.\r\n\r\nLong after this, a man was making his way through the wood when he heard\r\na raven calling, and he followed the sound of the voice. As he drew\r\nnear, the raven said, ‘I am by birth a king’s daughter, but am now under\r\nthe spell of some enchantment; you can, however, set me free.’ ‘What\r\nam I to do?’ he asked. She replied, ‘Go farther into the wood until you\r\ncome to a house, wherein lives an old woman; she will offer you food and\r\ndrink, but you must not take of either; if you do, you will fall into\r\na deep sleep, and will not be able to help me. In the garden behind the\r\nhouse is a large tan-heap, and on that you must stand and watch for me.\r\nI shall drive there in my carriage at two o’clock in the afternoon for\r\nthree successive days; the first day it will be drawn by four white, the\r\nsecond by four chestnut, and the last by four black horses; but if you\r\nfail to keep awake and I find you sleeping, I shall not be set free.’\r\n\r\nThe man promised to do all that she wished, but the raven said, ‘Alas! I\r\nknow even now that you will take something from the woman and be unable\r\nto save me.’ The man assured her again that he would on no account touch\r\na thing to eat or drink.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the house and went inside, the old woman met him, and\r\nsaid, ‘Poor man! how tired you are! Come in and rest and let me give you\r\nsomething to eat and drink.’\r\n\r\n‘No,’ answered the man, ‘I will neither eat not drink.’\r\n\r\nBut she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, ‘If you will\r\nnot eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink\r\ncounts for nothing,’ and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded, and\r\ndrank.\r\n\r\nAs it drew towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the garden\r\nand mounted the tan-heap to await the raven. Suddenly a feeling of\r\nfatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little\r\nwhile, fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in another minute\r\nhis eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a deep sleep,\r\nthat all the noises in the world would not have awakened him. At two\r\no’clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses;\r\nbut even before she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing, ‘I\r\nknow he has fallen asleep.’ When she entered the garden, there she found\r\nhim as she had feared, lying on the tan-heap, fast asleep. She got out\r\nof her carriage and went to him; she called him and shook him, but it\r\nwas all in vain, he still continued sleeping.\r\n\r\nThe next day at noon, the old woman came to him again with food and\r\ndrink which he at first refused. At last, overcome by her persistent\r\nentreaties that he would take something, he lifted the glass and drank\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nTowards two o’clock he went into the garden and on to the tan-heap to\r\nwatch for the raven. He had not been there long before he began to feel\r\nso tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him, and he could\r\nnot stand upright any longer; so again he lay down and fell fast asleep.\r\nAs the raven drove along her four chestnut horses, she said sorrowfully\r\nto herself, ‘I know he has fallen asleep.’ She went as before to look\r\nfor him, but he slept, and it was impossible to awaken him.\r\n\r\nThe following day the old woman said to him, ‘What is this? You are not\r\neating or drinking anything, do you want to kill yourself?’\r\n\r\nHe answered, ‘I may not and will not either eat or drink.’\r\n\r\nBut she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of him,\r\nand when he smelt the wine, he was unable to resist the temptation, and\r\ntook a deep draught.\r\n\r\nWhen the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tan-heap in\r\nthe garden to await the king’s daughter, but he felt even more overcome\r\nwith weariness than on the two previous days, and throwing himself down,\r\nhe slept like a log. At two o’clock the raven could be seen approaching,\r\nand this time her coachman and everything about her, as well as her\r\nhorses, were black.\r\n\r\nShe was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, ‘I\r\nknow he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free.’ She\r\nfound him sleeping heavily, and all her efforts to awaken him were of no\r\navail. Then she placed beside him a loaf, and some meat, and a flask\r\nof wine, of such a kind, that however much he took of them, they would\r\nnever grow less. After that she drew a gold ring, on which her name was\r\nengraved, off her finger, and put it upon one of his. Finally, she laid\r\na letter near him, in which, after giving him particulars of the food\r\nand drink she had left for him, she finished with the following words:\r\n‘I see that as long as you remain here you will never be able to set me\r\nfree; if, however, you still wish to do so, come to the golden castle\r\nof Stromberg; this is well within your power to accomplish.’ She then\r\nreturned to her carriage and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg.\r\n\r\nWhen the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was grieved\r\nat heart, and said, ‘She has no doubt been here and driven away again,\r\nand it is now too late for me to save her.’ Then his eyes fell on the\r\nthings which were lying beside him; he read the letter, and knew from it\r\nall that had happened. He rose up without delay, eager to start on his\r\nway and to reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no idea in which\r\ndirection he ought to go. He travelled about a long time in search of it\r\nand came at last to a dark forest, through which he went on walking for\r\nfourteen days and still could not find a way out. Once more the night\r\ncame on, and worn out he lay down under a bush and fell asleep. Again\r\nthe next day he pursued his way through the forest, and that evening,\r\nthinking to rest again, he lay down as before, but he heard such a\r\nhowling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep. He waited till\r\nit was darker and people had begun to light up their houses, and then\r\nseeing a little glimmer ahead of him, he went towards it.\r\n\r\nHe found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than\r\nit really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense\r\ngiant who stood in front of it. He thought to himself, ‘If the giant\r\nsees me going in, my life will not be worth much.’ However, after a\r\nwhile he summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw him,\r\nhe called out, ‘It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had\r\nanything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper.’ ‘I\r\nwould rather you let that alone,’ said the man, ‘for I do not willingly\r\ngive myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to\r\nsatisfy your hunger.’ ‘If that is so,’ replied the giant, ‘I will leave\r\nyou in peace; I only thought of eating you because I had nothing else.’\r\n\r\nSo they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought out the\r\nbread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of them,\r\nwere still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and\r\nate and drank to his heart’s content. When he had finished his supper\r\nthe man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg.\r\nThe giant said, ‘I will look on my map; on it are marked all the towns,\r\nvillages, and houses.’ So he fetched his map, and looked for the castle,\r\nbut could not find it. ‘Never mind,’ he said, ‘I have larger maps\r\nupstairs in the cupboard, we will look on those,’ but they searched in\r\nvain, for the castle was not marked even on these. The man now thought\r\nhe should like to continue his journey, but the giant begged him to\r\nremain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother, who was\r\naway in search of provisions. When the brother came home, they asked him\r\nabout the castle of Stromberg, and he told them he would look on his own\r\nmaps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger. Accordingly, when\r\nhe had finished his supper, they all went up together to his room and\r\nlooked through his maps, but the castle was not to be found. Then he\r\nfetched other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until\r\nat last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away. ‘How shall I\r\nbe able to get there?’ asked the man. ‘I have two hours to spare,’ said\r\nthe giant, ‘and I will carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle; I\r\nmust then return to look after the child who is in our care.’\r\n\r\nThe giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred leagues\r\nof the castle, where he left him, saying, ‘You will be able to walk the\r\nremainder of the way yourself.’ The man journeyed on day and night\r\ntill he reached the golden castle of Stromberg. He found it situated,\r\nhowever, on a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot he saw the\r\nenchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside. He was\r\noverjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but\r\nthe sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he\r\nfell back again. When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was\r\ngreatly grieved, and said to himself, ‘I will remain here and wait for\r\nher,’ so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for\r\na whole year, and every day he saw the king’s daughter driving round her\r\ncastle, but still was unable to get nearer to her.\r\n\r\nLooking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he\r\ncalled out to them, ‘God be with you.’ They stopped when they heard the\r\ncall, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their\r\nfighting, which now became more furious. ‘God be with you,’ he cried\r\nagain, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went\r\nback to their fighting. A third time he called out, ‘God be with you,’\r\nand then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between\r\nthe three men, he went out and asked them why they were fighting so\r\nangrily with one another. One of them said that he had found a stick,\r\nand that he had but to strike it against any door through which he\r\nwished to pass, and it immediately flew open. Another told him that he\r\nhad found a cloak which rendered its wearer invisible; and the third had\r\ncaught a horse which would carry its rider over any obstacle, and even\r\nup the glass mountain. They had been unable to decide whether they\r\nwould keep together and have the things in common, or whether they would\r\nseparate. On hearing this, the man said, ‘I will give you something in\r\nexchange for those three things; not money, for that I have not got,\r\nbut something that is of far more value. I must first, however, prove\r\nwhether all you have told me about your three things is true.’ The\r\nrobbers, therefore, made him get on the horse, and handed him the stick\r\nand the cloak, and when he had put this round him he was no longer\r\nvisible. Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one after\r\nanother, crying, ‘There, you idle vagabonds, you have got what you\r\ndeserve; are you satisfied now!’\r\n\r\nAfter this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the gate of\r\nthe castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his stick,\r\nand it flew wide open at once and he passed through. He mounted the\r\nsteps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting, with a golden\r\ngoblet full of wine in front of her. She could not see him for he still\r\nwore his cloak. He took the ring which she had given him off his finger,\r\nand threw it into the goblet, so that it rang as it touched the bottom.\r\n‘That is my own ring,’ she exclaimed, ‘and if that is so the man must\r\nalso be here who is coming to set me free.’\r\n\r\nShe sought for him about the castle, but could find him nowhere.\r\nMeanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown off\r\nthe cloak. When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him, and\r\ncried aloud for joy. Then he dismounted and took her in his arms; and\r\nshe kissed him, and said, ‘Now you have indeed set me free, and tomorrow\r\nwe will celebrate our marriage.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN GOOSE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called\r\nDummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion.\r\n\r\n     [*] Simpleton\r\n\r\nIt happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood,\r\nand before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a\r\nbottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.\r\n\r\nWhen he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade\r\nhim good day, and said: ‘Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket,\r\nand let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.’ But\r\nthe clever son answered: ‘If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have\r\nnone for myself; be off with you,’ and he left the little man standing\r\nand went on.\r\n\r\nBut when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a\r\nfalse stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home\r\nand have it bound up. And this was the little grey man’s doing.\r\n\r\nAfter this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave him,\r\nlike the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old grey man\r\nmet him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine.\r\nBut the second son, too, said sensibly enough: ‘What I give you will be\r\ntaken away from myself; be off!’ and he left the little man standing and\r\nwent on. His punishment, however, was not delayed; when he had made a\r\nfew blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be\r\ncarried home.\r\n\r\nThen Dummling said: ‘Father, do let me go and cut wood.’ The father\r\nanswered: ‘Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone,\r\nyou do not understand anything about it.’ But Dummling begged so long\r\nthat at last he said: ‘Just go then, you will get wiser by hurting\r\nyourself.’ His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the\r\ncinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise,\r\nand greeting him, said: ‘Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out\r\nof your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.’ Dummling answered: ‘I have\r\nonly cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit\r\ndown and eat.’ So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his\r\ncinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good\r\nwine. So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said: ‘Since\r\nyou have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will\r\ngive you good luck. There stands an old tree, cut it down, and you will\r\nfind something at the roots.’ Then the little man took leave of him.\r\n\r\nDummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose\r\nsitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her up, and\r\ntaking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the\r\nnight. Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were\r\ncurious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have\r\nliked to have one of its golden feathers.\r\n\r\nThe eldest thought: ‘I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a\r\nfeather,’ and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by\r\nthe wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.\r\n\r\nThe second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a\r\nfeather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she\r\nwas held fast.\r\n\r\nAt last the third also came with the like intent, and the others\r\nscreamed out: ‘Keep away; for goodness’ sake keep away!’ But she did\r\nnot understand why she was to keep away. ‘The others are there,’ she\r\nthought, ‘I may as well be there too,’ and ran to them; but as soon as\r\nshe had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her. So they\r\nhad to spend the night with the goose.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out,\r\nwithout troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to\r\nit. They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right,\r\nwherever his legs took him.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the\r\nprocession he said: ‘For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you\r\nrunning across the fields after this young man? Is that seemly?’ At the\r\nsame time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away,\r\nbut as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself\r\nobliged to run behind.\r\n\r\nBefore long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running\r\nbehind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out: ‘Hi!\r\nyour reverence, whither away so quickly? Do not forget that we have a\r\nchristening today!’ and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but\r\nwas also held fast to it.\r\n\r\nWhilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers\r\ncame with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them\r\nand begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had\r\nscarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were\r\nseven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.\r\n\r\nSoon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter\r\nwho was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he had put forth\r\na decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry\r\nher. When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train\r\nbefore the king’s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people\r\nrunning on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite\r\nloudly, and as if she would never stop. Thereupon Dummling asked to have\r\nher for his wife; but the king did not like the son-in-law, and made all\r\nmanner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink\r\na cellarful of wine. Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could\r\ncertainly help him; so he went into the forest, and in the same place\r\nwhere he had felled the tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very\r\nsorrowful face. Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so\r\nsorely, and he answered: ‘I have such a great thirst and cannot quench\r\nit; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of wine I have just emptied, but\r\nthat to me is like a drop on a hot stone!’\r\n\r\n‘There, I can help you,’ said Dummling, ‘just come with me and you shall\r\nbe satisfied.’\r\n\r\nHe led him into the king’s cellar, and the man bent over the huge\r\nbarrels, and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was\r\nout he had emptied all the barrels. Then Dummling asked once more\r\nfor his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom\r\neveryone called Dummling, should take away his daughter, and he made a\r\nnew condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain\r\nof bread. Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the\r\nforest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his\r\nbody with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: ‘I have eaten a\r\nwhole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger\r\nas I? My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to\r\ndie of hunger.’\r\n\r\nAt this Dummling was glad, and said: ‘Get up and come with me; you shall\r\neat yourself full.’ He led him to the king’s palace where all the\r\nflour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a huge\r\nmountain of bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood before it,\r\nbegan to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished.\r\nThen Dummling for the third time asked for his bride; but the king again\r\nsought a way out, and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on\r\nwater. ‘As soon as you come sailing back in it,’ said he, ‘you shall\r\nhave my daughter for wife.’\r\n\r\nDummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey\r\nman to whom he had given his cake. When he heard what Dummling wanted,\r\nhe said: ‘Since you have given me to eat and to drink, I will give you\r\nthe ship; and I do all this because you once were kind to me.’ Then he\r\ngave him the ship which could sail on land and water, and when the king\r\nsaw that, he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter. The\r\nwedding was celebrated, and after the king’s death, Dummling inherited\r\nhis kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WATER OF LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nLong before you or I were born, there reigned, in a country a great way\r\noff, a king who had three sons. This king once fell very ill--so ill\r\nthat nobody thought he could live. His sons were very much grieved\r\nat their father’s sickness; and as they were walking together very\r\nmournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and\r\nasked what was the matter. They told him that their father was very ill,\r\nand that they were afraid nothing could save him. ‘I know what would,’\r\nsaid the little old man; ‘it is the Water of Life. If he could have a\r\ndraught of it he would be well again; but it is very hard to get.’ Then\r\nthe eldest son said, ‘I will soon find it’: and he went to the sick\r\nking, and begged that he might go in search of the Water of Life, as\r\nit was the only thing that could save him. ‘No,’ said the king. ‘I had\r\nrather die than place you in such great danger as you must meet with in\r\nyour journey.’ But he begged so hard that the king let him go; and the\r\nprince thought to himself, ‘If I bring my father this water, he will\r\nmake me sole heir to his kingdom.’\r\n\r\nThen he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to a\r\ndeep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around, he\r\nsaw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf, with a\r\nsugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him and said,\r\n‘Prince, whither so fast?’ ‘What is that to thee, you ugly imp?’ said\r\nthe prince haughtily, and rode on.\r\n\r\nBut the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell\r\nof ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became\r\nnarrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he\r\ncould not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his\r\nhorse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing\r\nround him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was\r\nshut in all round. He next tried to get off his horse and make his way\r\non foot, but again the laugh rang in his ears, and he found himself\r\nunable to move a step, and thus he was forced to abide spellbound.\r\n\r\nMeantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his son’s\r\nreturn, till at last the second son said, ‘Father, I will go in search\r\nof the Water of Life.’ For he thought to himself, ‘My brother is surely\r\ndead, and the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water.’ The king was\r\nat first very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his wish.\r\nSo he set out and followed the same road which his brother had done,\r\nand met with the same elf, who stopped him at the same spot in the\r\nmountains, saying, as before, ‘Prince, prince, whither so fast?’ ‘Mind\r\nyour own affairs, busybody!’ said the prince scornfully, and rode on.\r\n\r\nBut the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder\r\nbrother, and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the\r\nheart of the mountains. Thus it is with proud silly people, who think\r\nthemselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take advice.\r\n\r\nWhen the second prince had thus been gone a long time, the youngest son\r\nsaid he would go and search for the Water of Life, and trusted he should\r\nsoon be able to make his father well again. So he set out, and the dwarf\r\nmet him too at the same spot in the valley, among the mountains, and\r\nsaid, ‘Prince, whither so fast?’ And the prince said, ‘I am going in\r\nsearch of the Water of Life, because my father is ill, and like to die:\r\ncan you help me? Pray be kind, and aid me if you can!’ ‘Do you know\r\nwhere it is to be found?’ asked the dwarf. ‘No,’ said the prince, ‘I do\r\nnot. Pray tell me if you know.’ ‘Then as you have spoken to me kindly,\r\nand are wise enough to seek for advice, I will tell you how and where to\r\ngo. The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and,\r\nthat you may be able to reach it in safety, I will give you an iron wand\r\nand two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three\r\ntimes with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying\r\ndown inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they\r\nwill let you pass; then hasten on to the well, and take some of the\r\nWater of Life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer\r\nthe door will shut upon you for ever.’\r\n\r\nThen the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for his\r\nfriendly aid, and took the wand and the bread, and went travelling on\r\nand on, over sea and over land, till he came to his journey’s end, and\r\nfound everything to be as the dwarf had told him. The door flew open at\r\nthe third stroke of the wand, and when the lions were quieted he went on\r\nthrough the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall. Around it he\r\nsaw several knights sitting in a trance; then he pulled off their rings\r\nand put them on his own fingers. In another room he saw on a table a\r\nsword and a loaf of bread, which he also took. Further on he came to a\r\nroom where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch; and she welcomed him\r\njoyfully, and said, if he would set her free from the spell that bound\r\nher, the kingdom should be his, if he would come back in a year and\r\nmarry her. Then she told him that the well that held the Water of Life\r\nwas in the palace gardens; and bade him make haste, and draw what he\r\nwanted before the clock struck twelve.\r\n\r\nHe walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a\r\ndelightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he thought to himself,\r\nas he felt tired, that he would rest himself for a while, and gaze on\r\nthe lovely scenes around him. So he laid himself down, and sleep\r\nfell upon him unawares, so that he did not wake up till the clock was\r\nstriking a quarter to twelve. Then he sprang from the couch dreadfully\r\nfrightened, ran to the well, filled a cup that was standing by him full\r\nof water, and hastened to get away in time. Just as he was going out of\r\nthe iron door it struck twelve, and the door fell so quickly upon him\r\nthat it snapped off a piece of his heel.\r\n\r\nWhen he found himself safe, he was overjoyed to think that he had got\r\nthe Water of Life; and as he was going on his way homewards, he passed\r\nby the little dwarf, who, when he saw the sword and the loaf, said, ‘You\r\nhave made a noble prize; with the sword you can at a blow slay whole\r\narmies, and the bread will never fail you.’ Then the prince thought\r\nto himself, ‘I cannot go home to my father without my brothers’; so he\r\nsaid, ‘My dear friend, cannot you tell me where my two brothers are, who\r\nset out in search of the Water of Life before me, and never came back?’\r\n‘I have shut them up by a charm between two mountains,’ said the dwarf,\r\n‘because they were proud and ill-behaved, and scorned to ask advice.’\r\nThe prince begged so hard for his brothers, that the dwarf at last set\r\nthem free, though unwillingly, saying, ‘Beware of them, for they have\r\nbad hearts.’ Their brother, however, was greatly rejoiced to see them,\r\nand told them all that had happened to him; how he had found the Water\r\nof Life, and had taken a cup full of it; and how he had set a beautiful\r\nprincess free from a spell that bound her; and how she had engaged to\r\nwait a whole year, and then to marry him, and to give him the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThen they all three rode on together, and on their way home came to a\r\ncountry that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine, so that it was\r\nfeared all must die for want. But the prince gave the king of the land\r\nthe bread, and all his kingdom ate of it. And he lent the king the\r\nwonderful sword, and he slew the enemy’s army with it; and thus the\r\nkingdom was once more in peace and plenty. In the same manner he\r\nbefriended two other countries through which they passed on their way.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the sea, they got into a ship and during their voyage\r\nthe two eldest said to themselves, ‘Our brother has got the water which\r\nwe could not find, therefore our father will forsake us and give him the\r\nkingdom, which is our right’; so they were full of envy and revenge, and\r\nagreed together how they could ruin him. Then they waited till he was\r\nfast asleep, and poured the Water of Life out of the cup, and took it\r\nfor themselves, giving him bitter sea-water instead.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to their journey’s end, the youngest son brought his cup\r\nto the sick king, that he might drink and be healed. Scarcely, however,\r\nhad he tasted the bitter sea-water when he became worse even than he was\r\nbefore; and then both the elder sons came in, and blamed the youngest\r\nfor what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison their father,\r\nbut that they had found the Water of Life, and had brought it with them.\r\nHe no sooner began to drink of what they brought him, than he felt his\r\nsickness leave him, and was as strong and well as in his younger days.\r\nThen they went to their brother, and laughed at him, and said, ‘Well,\r\nbrother, you found the Water of Life, did you? You have had the trouble\r\nand we shall have the reward. Pray, with all your cleverness, why did\r\nnot you manage to keep your eyes open? Next year one of us will take\r\naway your beautiful princess, if you do not take care. You had better\r\nsay nothing about this to our father, for he does not believe a word you\r\nsay; and if you tell tales, you shall lose your life into the bargain:\r\nbut be quiet, and we will let you off.’\r\n\r\nThe old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and thought\r\nthat he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his court\r\ntogether, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that he ought to\r\nbe put to death. The prince knew nothing of what was going on, till one\r\nday, when the king’s chief huntsmen went a-hunting with him, and they\r\nwere alone in the wood together, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that\r\nthe prince said, ‘My friend, what is the matter with you?’ ‘I cannot and\r\ndare not tell you,’ said he. But the prince begged very hard, and said,\r\n‘Only tell me what it is, and do not think I shall be angry, for I will\r\nforgive you.’ ‘Alas!’ said the huntsman; ‘the king has ordered me to\r\nshoot you.’ The prince started at this, and said, ‘Let me live, and I\r\nwill change dresses with you; you shall take my royal coat to show to my\r\nfather, and do you give me your shabby one.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said\r\nthe huntsman; ‘I am sure I shall be glad to save you, for I could not\r\nhave shot you.’ Then he took the prince’s coat, and gave him the shabby\r\none, and went away through the wood.\r\n\r\nSome time after, three grand embassies came to the old king’s court,\r\nwith rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest son; now\r\nall these were sent from the three kings to whom he had lent his sword\r\nand loaf of bread, in order to rid them of their enemy and feed their\r\npeople. This touched the old king’s heart, and he thought his son might\r\nstill be guiltless, and said to his court, ‘O that my son were still\r\nalive! how it grieves me that I had him killed!’ ‘He is still alive,’\r\nsaid the huntsman; ‘and I am glad that I had pity on him, but let him\r\ngo in peace, and brought home his royal coat.’ At this the king was\r\noverwhelmed with joy, and made it known throughout all his kingdom, that\r\nif his son would come back to his court he would forgive him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should\r\ncome back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining\r\ngold; and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback, and rode\r\nstraight up to the gate upon it, was her true lover; and that they must\r\nlet him in: but whoever rode on one side of it, they must be sure was\r\nnot the right one; and that they must send him away at once.\r\n\r\nThe time soon came, when the eldest brother thought that he would make\r\nhaste to go to the princess, and say that he was the one who had set\r\nher free, and that he should have her for his wife, and the kingdom with\r\nher. As he came before the palace and saw the golden road, he stopped to\r\nlook at it, and he thought to himself, ‘It is a pity to ride upon this\r\nbeautiful road’; so he turned aside and rode on the right-hand side of\r\nit. But when he came to the gate, the guards, who had seen the road\r\nhe took, said to him, he could not be what he said he was, and must go\r\nabout his business.\r\n\r\nThe second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and when\r\nhe came to the golden road, and his horse had set one foot upon it,\r\nhe stopped to look at it, and thought it very beautiful, and said to\r\nhimself, ‘What a pity it is that anything should tread here!’ Then he\r\ntoo turned aside and rode on the left side of it. But when he came to\r\nthe gate the guards said he was not the true prince, and that he too\r\nmust go away about his business; and away he went.\r\n\r\nNow when the full year was come round, the third brother left the forest\r\nin which he had lain hid for fear of his father’s anger, and set out in\r\nsearch of his betrothed bride. So he journeyed on, thinking of her all\r\nthe way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was\r\nmade of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the\r\ngate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with joy, and said\r\nhe was her deliverer, and should now be her husband and lord of the\r\nkingdom. When the first joy at their meeting was over, the princess told\r\nhim she had heard of his father having forgiven him, and of his wish to\r\nhave him home again: so, before his wedding with the princess, he went\r\nto visit his father, taking her with him. Then he told him everything;\r\nhow his brothers had cheated and robbed him, and yet that he had borne\r\nall those wrongs for the love of his father. And the old king was very\r\nangry, and wanted to punish his wicked sons; but they made their escape,\r\nand got into a ship and sailed away over the wide sea, and where they\r\nwent to nobody knew and nobody cared.\r\n\r\nAnd now the old king gathered together his court, and asked all his\r\nkingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess.\r\nAnd young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once\r\non the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the\r\nsugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak.\r\n\r\n  And the wedding was held, and the merry bells run.\r\n  And all the good people they danced and they sung,\r\n  And feasted and frolick’d I can’t tell how long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWELVE HUNTSMEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a king’s son who had a bride whom he loved very much. And\r\nwhen he was sitting beside her and very happy, news came that his father\r\nlay sick unto death, and desired to see him once again before his end.\r\nThen he said to his beloved: ‘I must now go and leave you, I give you\r\na ring as a remembrance of me. When I am king, I will return and fetch\r\nyou.’ So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was\r\ndangerously ill, and near his death. He said to him: ‘Dear son, I wished\r\nto see you once again before my end, promise me to marry as I wish,’ and\r\nhe named a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife. The son was\r\nin such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said: ‘Yes,\r\ndear father, your will shall be done,’ and thereupon the king shut his\r\neyes, and died.\r\n\r\nWhen therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of\r\nmourning was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had given\r\nhis father, and caused the king’s daughter to be asked in marriage, and\r\nshe was promised to him. His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted\r\nso much about his faithfulness that she nearly died. Then her father\r\nsaid to her: ‘Dearest child, why are you so sad? You shall have\r\nwhatsoever you will.’ She thought for a moment and said: ‘Dear father,\r\nI wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face, figure, and size.’\r\nThe father said: ‘If it be possible, your desire shall be fulfilled,’\r\nand he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom, until eleven\r\nyoung maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in face,\r\nfigure, and size.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the king’s daughter, she had twelve suits of\r\nhuntsmen’s clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to put\r\non the huntsmen’s clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit.\r\nThereupon she took her leave of her father, and rode away with them,\r\nand rode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly.\r\nThen she asked if he required any huntsmen, and if he would take all of\r\nthem into his service. The king looked at her and did not know her, but\r\nas they were such handsome fellows, he said: ‘Yes,’ and that he would\r\nwillingly take them, and now they were the king’s twelve huntsmen.\r\n\r\nThe king, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew\r\nall concealed and secret things. It came to pass that one evening he\r\nsaid to the king: ‘You think you have twelve huntsmen?’ ‘Yes,’ said the\r\nking, ‘they are twelve huntsmen.’ The lion continued: ‘You are mistaken,\r\nthey are twelve girls.’ The king said: ‘That cannot be true! How\r\nwill you prove that to me?’ ‘Oh, just let some peas be strewn in the\r\nante-chamber,’ answered the lion, ‘and then you will soon see. Men have\r\na firm step, and when they walk over peas none of them stir, but girls\r\ntrip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about.’ The king\r\nwas well pleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a servant of the king’s who favoured the huntsmen,\r\nand when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went to\r\nthem and repeated everything, and said: ‘The lion wants to make the king\r\nbelieve that you are girls.’ Then the king’s daughter thanked him, and\r\nsaid to her maidens: ‘Show some strength, and step firmly on the peas.’\r\nSo next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called before\r\nhim, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they\r\nstepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not\r\none of the peas either rolled or stirred. Then they went away again,\r\nand the king said to the lion: ‘You have lied to me, they walk just like\r\nmen.’ The lion said: ‘They have been informed that they were going to\r\nbe put to the test, and have assumed some strength. Just let twelve\r\nspinning-wheels be brought into the ante-chamber, and they will go to\r\nthem and be pleased with them, and that is what no man would do.’\r\nThe king liked the advice, and had the spinning-wheels placed in the\r\nante-chamber.\r\n\r\nBut the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them,\r\nand disclosed the project. So when they were alone the king’s daughter\r\nsaid to her eleven girls: ‘Show some constraint, and do not look round\r\nat the spinning-wheels.’ And next morning when the king had his twelve\r\nhuntsmen summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once\r\nlooked at the spinning-wheels. Then the king again said to the lion:\r\n‘You have deceived me, they are men, for they have not looked at the\r\nspinning-wheels.’ The lion replied: ‘They have restrained themselves.’\r\nThe king, however, would no longer believe the lion.\r\n\r\nThe twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase, and his\r\nliking for them continually increased. Now it came to pass that\r\nonce when they were out hunting, news came that the king’s bride was\r\napproaching. When the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much that\r\nher heart was almost broken, and she fell fainting to the ground. The\r\nking thought something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him,\r\nwanted to help him, and drew his glove off. Then he saw the ring which\r\nhe had given to his first bride, and when he looked in her face he\r\nrecognized her. Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and\r\nwhen she opened her eyes he said: ‘You are mine, and I am yours, and\r\nno one in the world can alter that.’ He sent a messenger to the other\r\nbride, and entreated her to return to her own kingdom, for he had a wife\r\nalready, and someone who had just found an old key did not require a new\r\none. Thereupon the wedding was celebrated, and the lion was again taken\r\ninto favour, because, after all, he had told the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KING OF THE GOLDEN MOUNTAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very\r\nyoung, and barely able to run alone. He had two richly laden ships then\r\nmaking a voyage upon the seas, in which he had embarked all his wealth,\r\nin the hope of making great gains, when the news came that both were\r\nlost. Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor that\r\nnothing was left to him but one small plot of land; and there he often\r\nwent in an evening to take his walk, and ease his mind of a little of\r\nhis trouble.\r\n\r\nOne day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no\r\ngreat comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like\r\nto be, all on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking,\r\nblack dwarf. ‘Prithee, friend, why so sorrowful?’ said he to the\r\nmerchant; ‘what is it you take so deeply to heart?’ ‘If you would do me\r\nany good I would willingly tell you,’ said the merchant. ‘Who knows but\r\nI may?’ said the little man: ‘tell me what ails you, and perhaps you\r\nwill find I may be of some use.’ Then the merchant told him how all his\r\nwealth was gone to the bottom of the sea, and how he had nothing left\r\nbut that little plot of land. ‘Oh, trouble not yourself about that,’\r\nsaid the dwarf; ‘only undertake to bring me here, twelve years hence,\r\nwhatever meets you first on your going home, and I will give you as much\r\nas you please.’ The merchant thought this was no great thing to ask;\r\nthat it would most likely be his dog or his cat, or something of that\r\nsort, but forgot his little boy Heinel; so he agreed to the bargain, and\r\nsigned and sealed the bond to do what was asked of him.\r\n\r\nBut as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he\r\ncrept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in\r\nhis face and laughed. Then the father started, trembling with fear and\r\nhorror, and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no\r\ngold was come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke\r\nthat the dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the money\r\ncame, he should see the bearer, and would not take it in.\r\n\r\nAbout a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber-room to look\r\nfor some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money; and\r\nthere, instead of his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the\r\nfloor. At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about\r\nhis son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nMeantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years drew\r\nnear the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very sad\r\nand thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face. The\r\nboy one day asked what was the matter, but his father would not tell for\r\nsome time; at last, however, he said that he had, without knowing it,\r\nsold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the\r\ntwelve years were coming round when he must keep his word. Then Heinel\r\nsaid, ‘Father, give yourself very little trouble about that; I shall be\r\ntoo much for the little man.’\r\n\r\nWhen the time came, the father and son went out together to the place\r\nagreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself\r\nand his father in the middle of it. The little black dwarf soon came,\r\nand walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any way\r\nto get into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over it. At\r\nlast the boy said to him. ‘Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or\r\nwhat do you want?’ Now Heinel had found a friend in a good fairy, that\r\nwas fond of him, and had told him what to do; for this fairy knew what\r\ngood luck was in store for him. ‘Have you brought me what you said you\r\nwould?’ said the dwarf to the merchant. The old man held his tongue, but\r\nHeinel said again, ‘What do you want here?’ The dwarf said, ‘I come to\r\ntalk with your father, not with you.’ ‘You have cheated and taken in my\r\nfather,’ said the son; ‘pray give him up his bond at once.’ ‘Fair and\r\nsoftly,’ said the little old man; ‘right is right; I have paid my money,\r\nand your father has had it, and spent it; so be so good as to let me\r\nhave what I paid it for.’ ‘You must have my consent to that first,’ said\r\nHeinel, ‘so please to step in here, and let us talk it over.’ The old\r\nman grinned, and showed his teeth, as if he should have been very glad\r\nto get into the circle if he could. Then at last, after a long talk,\r\nthey came to terms. Heinel agreed that his father must give him up, and\r\nthat so far the dwarf should have his way: but, on the other hand, the\r\nfairy had told Heinel what fortune was in store for him, if he followed\r\nhis own course; and he did not choose to be given up to his hump-backed\r\nfriend, who seemed so anxious for his company.\r\n\r\nSo, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that\r\nHeinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard\r\nby; that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he\r\nshould thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind and\r\nweather. Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat,\r\nbut before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side\r\nlow in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and\r\nwent home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at\r\nany rate he had had his revenge.\r\n\r\nThe boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her\r\nfriend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on. The\r\nyoung man sat safe within, till at length it ran ashore upon an unknown\r\nland. As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castle\r\nbut empty and dreary within, for it was enchanted. ‘Here,’ said he to\r\nhimself, ‘must I find the prize the good fairy told me of.’ So he once\r\nmore searched the whole palace through, till at last he found a white\r\nsnake, lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers.\r\n\r\nNow the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad\r\nto see him, and said, ‘Are you at last come to set me free? Twelve\r\nlong years have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as she\r\npromised, for you alone can save me. This night twelve men will come:\r\ntheir faces will be black, and they will be dressed in chain armour.\r\nThey will ask what you do here, but give no answer; and let them do\r\nwhat they will--beat, whip, pinch, prick, or torment you--bear all; only\r\nspeak not a word, and at twelve o’clock they must go away. The second\r\nnight twelve others will come: and the third night twenty-four, who\r\nwill even cut off your head; but at the twelfth hour of that night their\r\npower is gone, and I shall be free, and will come and bring you the\r\nWater of Life, and will wash you with it, and bring you back to life\r\nand health.’ And all came to pass as she had said; Heinel bore all, and\r\nspoke not a word; and the third night the princess came, and fell on his\r\nneck and kissed him. Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle,\r\nthe wedding was celebrated, and he was crowned king of the Golden\r\nMountain.\r\n\r\nThey lived together very happily, and the queen had a son. And thus\r\neight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his\r\nfather; and he began to long to see him once again. But the queen was\r\nagainst his going, and said, ‘I know well that misfortunes will come\r\nupon us if you go.’ However, he gave her no rest till she agreed. At his\r\ngoing away she gave him a wishing-ring, and said, ‘Take this ring, and\r\nput it on your finger; whatever you wish it will bring you; only promise\r\nnever to make use of it to bring me hence to your father’s house.’ Then\r\nhe said he would do what she asked, and put the ring on his finger, and\r\nwished himself near the town where his father lived.\r\n\r\nHeinel found himself at the gates in a moment; but the guards would\r\nnot let him go in, because he was so strangely clad. So he went up to a\r\nneighbouring hill, where a shepherd dwelt, and borrowed his old frock,\r\nand thus passed unknown into the town. When he came to his father’s\r\nhouse, he said he was his son; but the merchant would not believe him,\r\nand said he had had but one son, his poor Heinel, who he knew was long\r\nsince dead: and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd, he would\r\nnot even give him anything to eat. The king, however, still vowed that\r\nhe was his son, and said, ‘Is there no mark by which you would know me\r\nif I am really your son?’ ‘Yes,’ said his mother, ‘our Heinel had a mark\r\nlike a raspberry on his right arm.’ Then he showed them the mark, and\r\nthey knew that what he had said was true.\r\n\r\nHe next told them how he was king of the Golden Mountain, and was\r\nmarried to a princess, and had a son seven years old. But the merchant\r\nsaid, ‘that can never be true; he must be a fine king truly who travels\r\nabout in a shepherd’s frock!’ At this the son was vexed; and forgetting\r\nhis word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son. In an\r\ninstant they stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had\r\nbroken his word, and bad luck would follow. He did all he could to\r\nsoothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in\r\ntruth, and was only thinking how she should punish him.\r\n\r\nOne day he took her to walk with him out of the town, and showed her\r\nthe spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then he sat\r\nhimself down, and said, ‘I am very much tired; sit by me, I will rest my\r\nhead in your lap, and sleep a while.’ As soon as he had fallen asleep,\r\nhowever, she drew the ring from his finger, and crept softly away, and\r\nwished herself and her son at home in their kingdom. And when he awoke\r\nhe found himself alone, and saw that the ring was gone from his finger.\r\n‘I can never go back to my father’s house,’ said he; ‘they would say I\r\nam a sorcerer: I will journey forth into the world, till I come again to\r\nmy kingdom.’\r\n\r\nSo saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill, where three\r\ngiants were sharing their father’s goods; and as they saw him pass they\r\ncried out and said, ‘Little men have sharp wits; he shall part the goods\r\nbetween us.’ Now there was a sword that cut off an enemy’s head whenever\r\nthe wearer gave the words, ‘Heads off!’; a cloak that made the owner\r\ninvisible, or gave him any form he pleased; and a pair of boots that\r\ncarried the wearer wherever he wished. Heinel said they must first let\r\nhim try these wonderful things, then he might know how to set a value\r\nupon them. Then they gave him the cloak, and he wished himself a fly,\r\nand in a moment he was a fly. ‘The cloak is very well,’ said he: ‘now\r\ngive me the sword.’ ‘No,’ said they; ‘not unless you undertake not to\r\nsay, “Heads off!” for if you do we are all dead men.’ So they gave it\r\nhim, charging him to try it on a tree. He next asked for the boots also;\r\nand the moment he had all three in his power, he wished himself at\r\nthe Golden Mountain; and there he was at once. So the giants were left\r\nbehind with no goods to share or quarrel about.\r\n\r\nAs Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music; and\r\nthe people around told him that his queen was about to marry another\r\nhusband. Then he threw his cloak around him, and passed through the\r\ncastle hall, and placed himself by the side of the queen, where no one\r\nsaw him. But when anything to eat was put upon her plate, he took it\r\naway and ate it himself; and when a glass of wine was handed to her, he\r\ntook it and drank it; and thus, though they kept on giving her meat and\r\ndrink, her plate and cup were always empty.\r\n\r\nUpon this, fear and remorse came over her, and she went into her chamber\r\nalone, and sat there weeping; and he followed her there. ‘Alas!’ said\r\nshe to herself, ‘was I not once set free? Why then does this enchantment\r\nstill seem to bind me?’\r\n\r\n‘False and fickle one!’ said he. ‘One indeed came who set thee free, and\r\nhe is now near thee again; but how have you used him? Ought he to\r\nhave had such treatment from thee?’ Then he went out and sent away the\r\ncompany, and said the wedding was at an end, for that he was come back\r\nto the kingdom. But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at him.\r\nHowever, he would enter into no parley with them, but only asked them\r\nif they would go in peace or not. Then they turned upon him and tried\r\nto seize him; but he drew his sword. ‘Heads Off!’ cried he; and with the\r\nword the traitors’ heads fell before him, and Heinel was once more king\r\nof the Golden Mountain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCTOR KNOWALL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with\r\ntwo oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two\r\ntalers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that\r\nthe doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he\r\nate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly\r\nhave been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length\r\ninquired if he too could not be a doctor. ‘Oh, yes,’ said the doctor,\r\n‘that is soon managed.’ ‘What must I do?’ asked the peasant. ‘In the\r\nfirst place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on\r\nthe frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into\r\nmoney, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to\r\nmedicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words: “I\r\nam Doctor Knowall,” and have that nailed up above your house-door.’ The\r\npeasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored\r\npeople awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money\r\nstolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such\r\na village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had\r\nthe horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and\r\nasked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was\r\nto go with him and bring back the stolen money. ‘Oh, yes, but Grete, my\r\nwife, must go too.’ The lord was willing, and let both of them have a\r\nseat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. When they came\r\nto the nobleman’s castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to\r\nsit down and eat. ‘Yes, but my wife, Grete, too,’ said he, and he seated\r\nhimself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a\r\ndish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: ‘Grete,\r\nthat was the first,’ meaning that was the servant who brought the first\r\ndish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: ‘That is\r\nthe first thief,’ and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said\r\nto his comrade outside: ‘The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he\r\nsaid I was the first.’ The second did not want to go in at all, but was\r\nforced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife,\r\nand said: ‘Grete, that is the second.’ This servant was equally alarmed,\r\nand he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better, for the\r\npeasant again said: ‘Grete, that is the third.’ The fourth had to carry\r\nin a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to\r\nshow his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually, there\r\nwere crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and\r\ncried: ‘Ah, poor Crabb.’ When the lord heard that, he cried: ‘There! he\r\nknows it; he must also know who has the money!’\r\n\r\nOn this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the\r\ndoctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore\r\nhe went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen\r\nthe money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a\r\nheavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he\r\ndid they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was\r\nconcealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall,\r\nsat down to the table, and said: ‘My lord, now will I search in my book\r\nwhere the gold is hidden.’ The fifth servant, however, crept into the\r\nstove to hear if the doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still\r\nand opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and\r\nlooked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said: ‘I\r\nknow you are there, so you had better come out!’ Then the fellow in the\r\nstove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out,\r\ncrying: ‘That man knows everything!’ Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord\r\nwhere the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received\r\nfrom both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEVEN RAVENS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a man who had seven sons, and last of all one daughter.\r\nAlthough the little girl was very pretty, she was so weak and small that\r\nthey thought she could not live; but they said she should at once be\r\nchristened.\r\n\r\nSo the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get some\r\nwater, but the other six ran with him. Each wanted to be first at\r\ndrawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their\r\npitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at\r\none another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home. In the\r\nmeantime the father was uneasy, and could not tell what made the\r\nyoung men stay so long. ‘Surely,’ said he, ‘the whole seven must have\r\nforgotten themselves over some game of play’; and when he had waited\r\nstill longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished\r\nthem all turned into ravens. Scarcely had he spoken these words when he\r\nheard a croaking over his head, and looked up and saw seven ravens as\r\nblack as coal flying round and round. Sorry as he was to see his wish\r\nso fulfilled, he did not know how what was done could be undone, and\r\ncomforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons\r\nwith his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and every day\r\nmore beautiful.\r\n\r\nFor a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers; for\r\nher father and mother took care not to speak of them before her: but one\r\nday by chance she heard the people about her speak of them. ‘Yes,’ said\r\nthey, ‘she is beautiful indeed, but still ‘tis a pity that her brothers\r\nshould have been lost for her sake.’ Then she was much grieved, and went\r\nto her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what\r\nhad become of them. So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but\r\nsaid it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent\r\ncause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and\r\nthought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back;\r\nand she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole\r\naway, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever\r\nthey might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her.\r\n\r\nShe took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother\r\nhad given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry, a little\r\npitcher of water in case she should be thirsty, and a little stool\r\nto rest upon when she should be weary. Thus she went on and on, and\r\njourneyed till she came to the world’s end; then she came to the sun,\r\nbut the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to\r\nthe moon, but the moon was cold and chilly, and said, ‘I smell flesh\r\nand blood this way!’ so she took herself away in a hurry and came to the\r\nstars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her, and each star sat\r\nupon his own little stool; but the morning star rose up and gave her a\r\nlittle piece of wood, and said, ‘If you have not this little piece of\r\nwood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass-mountain,\r\nand there your brothers live.’ The little girl took the piece of wood,\r\nrolled it up in a little cloth, and went on again until she came to the\r\nglass-mountain, and found the door shut. Then she felt for the little\r\npiece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there, and\r\nshe saw she had lost the gift of the good stars. What was to be done?\r\nShe wanted to save her brothers, and had no key of the castle of the\r\nglass-mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her\r\npocket and cut off her little finger, that was just the size of the\r\npiece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door and opened it.\r\n\r\nAs she went in, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, ‘What are you\r\nseeking for?’ ‘I seek for my brothers, the seven ravens,’ answered she.\r\nThen the dwarf said, ‘My masters are not at home; but if you will wait\r\ntill they come, pray step in.’ Now the little dwarf was getting their\r\ndinner ready, and he brought their food upon seven little plates, and\r\ntheir drink in seven little glasses, and set them upon the table, and\r\nout of each little plate their sister ate a small piece, and out of each\r\nlittle glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that she had\r\nbrought with her fall into the last glass.\r\n\r\nOn a sudden she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air, and the\r\ndwarf said, ‘Here come my masters.’ When they came in, they wanted to\r\neat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said\r\none after the other,\r\n\r\n‘Who has eaten from my little plate? And who has been drinking out of my\r\nlittle glass?’\r\n\r\n ‘Caw! Caw! well I ween\r\n  Mortal lips have this way been.’\r\n\r\nWhen the seventh came to the bottom of his glass, and found there the\r\nring, he looked at it, and knew that it was his father’s and mother’s,\r\nand said, ‘O that our little sister would but come! then we should be\r\nfree.’ When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door\r\nall the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all\r\nthe ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each\r\nother, and went merrily home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WEDDING OF MRS FOX\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST STORY\r\n\r\nThere was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that\r\nhis wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test. He\r\nstretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved\r\nas if he were stone dead. Mrs Fox went up to her room, shut herself in,\r\nand her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking. When it\r\nbecame known that the old fox was dead, suitors presented themselves.\r\nThe maid heard someone standing at the house-door, knocking. She went\r\nand opened it, and it was a young fox, who said:\r\n\r\n ‘What may you be about, Miss Cat?\r\n  Do you sleep or do you wake?’\r\n\r\nShe answered:\r\n\r\n ‘I am not sleeping, I am waking,\r\n  Would you know what I am making?\r\n  I am boiling warm beer with butter,\r\n  Will you be my guest for supper?’\r\n\r\n‘No, thank you, miss,’ said the fox, ‘what is Mrs Fox doing?’ The maid\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n ‘She is sitting in her room,\r\n  Moaning in her gloom,\r\n  Weeping her little eyes quite red,\r\n  Because old Mr Fox is dead.’\r\n\r\n‘Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo\r\nher.’ ‘Certainly, young sir.’\r\n\r\n  The cat goes up the stairs trip, trap,\r\n  The door she knocks at tap, tap, tap,\r\n ‘Mistress Fox, are you inside?’\r\n ‘Oh, yes, my little cat,’ she cried.\r\n ‘A wooer he stands at the door out there.’\r\n ‘What does he look like, my dear?’\r\n\r\n‘Has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr Fox?’ ‘Oh, no,’ answered\r\nthe cat, ‘he has only one.’ ‘Then I will not have him.’\r\n\r\nMiss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away. Soon afterwards there\r\nwas another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs\r\nFox. He had two tails, but he did not fare better than the first. After\r\nthis still more came, each with one tail more than the other, but they\r\nwere all turned away, until at last one came who had nine tails, like\r\nold Mr Fox. When the widow heard that, she said joyfully to the cat:\r\n\r\n ‘Now open the gates and doors all wide,\r\n  And carry old Mr Fox outside.’\r\n\r\nBut just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old Mr Fox stirred\r\nunder the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and Mrs\r\nFox out of the house.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND STORY\r\n\r\nWhen old Mr Fox was dead, the wolf came as a suitor, and knocked at the\r\ndoor, and the cat who was servant to Mrs Fox, opened it for him. The\r\nwolf greeted her, and said:\r\n\r\n ‘Good day, Mrs Cat of Kehrewit,\r\n  How comes it that alone you sit?\r\n  What are you making good?’\r\n\r\nThe cat replied:\r\n\r\n ‘In milk I’m breaking bread so sweet,\r\n  Will you be my guest, and eat?’\r\n\r\n‘No, thank you, Mrs Cat,’ answered the wolf. ‘Is Mrs Fox not at home?’\r\n\r\nThe cat said:\r\n\r\n ‘She sits upstairs in her room,\r\n  Bewailing her sorrowful doom,\r\n  Bewailing her trouble so sore,\r\n  For old Mr Fox is no more.’\r\n\r\nThe wolf answered:\r\n\r\n ‘If she’s in want of a husband now,\r\n  Then will it please her to step below?’\r\n  The cat runs quickly up the stair,\r\n  And lets her tail fly here and there,\r\n  Until she comes to the parlour door.\r\n  With her five gold rings at the door she knocks:\r\n ‘Are you within, good Mistress Fox?\r\n  If you’re in want of a husband now,\r\n  Then will it please you to step below?\r\n\r\nMrs Fox asked: ‘Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a pointed\r\nmouth?’ ‘No,’ answered the cat. ‘Then he won’t do for me.’\r\n\r\nWhen the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion, and\r\nall the beasts of the forest, one after the other. But one of the good\r\nqualities which old Mr Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and the\r\ncat had continually to send the suitors away. At length came a young\r\nfox. Then Mrs Fox said: ‘Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has a\r\nlittle pointed mouth?’ ‘Yes,’ said the cat, ‘he has.’ ‘Then let him come\r\nupstairs,’ said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding\r\nfeast.\r\n\r\n ‘Sweep me the room as clean as you can,\r\n  Up with the window, fling out my old man!\r\n  For many a fine fat mouse he brought,\r\n  Yet of his wife he never thought,\r\n  But ate up every one he caught.’\r\n\r\nThen the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much\r\nrejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SALAD\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a merry young huntsman was once going briskly along through a wood,\r\nthere came up a little old woman, and said to him, ‘Good day, good day;\r\nyou seem merry enough, but I am hungry and thirsty; do pray give me\r\nsomething to eat.’ The huntsman took pity on her, and put his hand in\r\nhis pocket and gave her what he had. Then he wanted to go his way; but\r\nshe took hold of him, and said, ‘Listen, my friend, to what I am going\r\nto tell you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way, and after\r\na little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds\r\nsitting on a cloak. Shoot into the midst of them, and one will fall down\r\ndead: the cloak will fall too; take it, it is a wishing-cloak, and when\r\nyou wear it you will find yourself at any place where you may wish to\r\nbe. Cut open the dead bird, take out its heart and keep it, and you will\r\nfind a piece of gold under your pillow every morning when you rise. It\r\nis the bird’s heart that will bring you this good luck.’\r\n\r\nThe huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, ‘If all this does\r\nhappen, it will be a fine thing for me.’ When he had gone a hundred\r\nsteps or so, he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over him,\r\nand looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their bills\r\nand feet; screaming, fighting, and tugging at each other as if\r\neach wished to have it himself. ‘Well,’ said the huntsman, ‘this is\r\nwonderful; this happens just as the old woman said’; then he shot into\r\nthe midst of them so that their feathers flew all about. Off went the\r\nflock chattering away; but one fell down dead, and the cloak with it.\r\nThen the huntsman did as the old woman told him, cut open the bird, took\r\nout the heart, and carried the cloak home with him.\r\n\r\nThe next morning when he awoke he lifted up his pillow, and there lay\r\nthe piece of gold glittering underneath; the same happened next day, and\r\nindeed every day when he arose. He heaped up a great deal of gold, and\r\nat last thought to himself, ‘Of what use is this gold to me whilst I am\r\nat home? I will go out into the world and look about me.’\r\n\r\nThen he took leave of his friends, and hung his bag and bow about his\r\nneck, and went his way. It so happened that his road one day led through\r\na thick wood, at the end of which was a large castle in a green meadow,\r\nand at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very beautiful young\r\nlady by her side looking about them. Now the old woman was a witch, and\r\nsaid to the young lady, ‘There is a young man coming out of the wood who\r\ncarries a wonderful prize; we must get it away from him, my dear child,\r\nfor it is more fit for us than for him. He has a bird’s heart that\r\nbrings a piece of gold under his pillow every morning.’ Meantime the\r\nhuntsman came nearer and looked at the lady, and said to himself, ‘I\r\nhave been travelling so long that I should like to go into this castle\r\nand rest myself, for I have money enough to pay for anything I want’;\r\nbut the real reason was, that he wanted to see more of the beautiful\r\nlady. Then he went into the house, and was welcomed kindly; and it was\r\nnot long before he was so much in love that he thought of nothing else\r\nbut looking at the lady’s eyes, and doing everything that she wished.\r\nThen the old woman said, ‘Now is the time for getting the bird’s heart.’\r\nSo the lady stole it away, and he never found any more gold under his\r\npillow, for it lay now under the young lady’s, and the old woman took it\r\naway every morning; but he was so much in love that he never missed his\r\nprize.\r\n\r\n‘Well,’ said the old witch, ‘we have got the bird’s heart, but not the\r\nwishing-cloak yet, and that we must also get.’ ‘Let us leave him that,’\r\nsaid the young lady; ‘he has already lost his wealth.’ Then the witch\r\nwas very angry, and said, ‘Such a cloak is a very rare and wonderful\r\nthing, and I must and will have it.’ So she did as the old woman told\r\nher, and set herself at the window, and looked about the country and\r\nseemed very sorrowful; then the huntsman said, ‘What makes you so sad?’\r\n‘Alas! dear sir,’ said she, ‘yonder lies the granite rock where all the\r\ncostly diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there, that whenever I\r\nthink of it I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach it? only\r\nthe birds and the flies--man cannot.’ ‘If that’s all your grief,’ said\r\nthe huntsman, ‘I’ll take you there with all my heart’; so he drew her under\r\nhis cloak, and the moment he wished to be on the granite mountain they\r\nwere both there. The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were\r\ndelighted with the sight and picked up the finest. But the old witch\r\nmade a deep sleep come upon him, and he said to the young lady, ‘Let us\r\nsit down and rest ourselves a little, I am so tired that I cannot stand\r\nany longer.’ So they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap and\r\nfell asleep; and whilst he was sleeping on she took the cloak from\r\nhis shoulders, hung it on her own, picked up the diamonds, and wished\r\nherself home again.\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left him\r\nalone on the wild rock, he said, ‘Alas! what roguery there is in the\r\nworld!’ and there he sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what to\r\ndo. Now this rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it; and as\r\nhe saw three of them striding about, he thought to himself, ‘I can only\r\nsave myself by feigning to be asleep’; so he laid himself down as if he\r\nwere in a sound sleep. When the giants came up to him, the first pushed\r\nhim with his foot, and said, ‘What worm is this that lies here curled\r\nup?’ ‘Tread upon him and kill him,’ said the second. ‘It’s not worth the\r\ntrouble,’ said the third; ‘let him live, he’ll go climbing higher up the\r\nmountain, and some cloud will come rolling and carry him away.’ And they\r\npassed on. But the huntsman had heard all they said; and as soon as they\r\nwere gone, he climbed to the top of the mountain, and when he had sat\r\nthere a short time a cloud came rolling around him, and caught him in a\r\nwhirlwind and bore him along for some time, till it settled in a garden,\r\nand he fell quite gently to the ground amongst the greens and cabbages.\r\n\r\nThen he looked around him, and said, ‘I wish I had something to eat, if\r\nnot I shall be worse off than before; for here I see neither apples\r\nnor pears, nor any kind of fruits, nothing but vegetables.’ At last he\r\nthought to himself, ‘I can eat salad, it will refresh and strengthen\r\nme.’ So he picked out a fine head and ate of it; but scarcely had he\r\nswallowed two bites when he felt himself quite changed, and saw with\r\nhorror that he was turned into an ass. However, he still felt very\r\nhungry, and the salad tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came\r\nto another kind of salad, and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt\r\nanother change come over him, and soon saw that he was lucky enough to\r\nhave found his old shape again.\r\n\r\nThen he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness; and\r\nwhen he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good and\r\nthe bad salad, and thought to himself, ‘This will help me to my fortune\r\nagain, and enable me to pay off some folks for their treachery.’ So he\r\nwent away to try and find the castle of his friends; and after wandering\r\nabout a few days he luckily found it. Then he stained his face all over\r\nbrown, so that even his mother would not have known him, and went into\r\nthe castle and asked for a lodging; ‘I am so tired,’ said he, ‘that I\r\ncan go no farther.’ ‘Countryman,’ said the witch, ‘who are you? and what\r\nis your business?’ ‘I am,’ said he, ‘a messenger sent by the king to\r\nfind the finest salad that grows under the sun. I have been lucky\r\nenough to find it, and have brought it with me; but the heat of the sun\r\nscorches so that it begins to wither, and I don’t know that I can carry\r\nit farther.’\r\n\r\nWhen the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad, they\r\nlonged to taste it, and said, ‘Dear countryman, let us just taste it.’\r\n‘To be sure,’ answered he; ‘I have two heads of it with me, and will\r\ngive you one’; so he opened his bag and gave them the bad. Then the\r\nwitch herself took it into the kitchen to be dressed; and when it was\r\nready she could not wait till it was carried up, but took a few leaves\r\nimmediately and put them in her mouth, and scarcely were they swallowed\r\nwhen she lost her own form and ran braying down into the court in the\r\nform of an ass. Now the servant-maid came into the kitchen, and seeing\r\nthe salad ready, was going to carry it up; but on the way she too felt a\r\nwish to taste it as the old woman had done, and ate some leaves; so she\r\nalso was turned into an ass and ran after the other, letting the dish\r\nwith the salad fall on the ground. The messenger sat all this time with\r\nthe beautiful young lady, and as nobody came with the salad and she\r\nlonged to taste it, she said, ‘I don’t know where the salad can be.’\r\nThen he thought something must have happened, and said, ‘I will go\r\ninto the kitchen and see.’ And as he went he saw two asses in the court\r\nrunning about, and the salad lying on the ground. ‘All right!’ said\r\nhe; ‘those two have had their share.’ Then he took up the rest of\r\nthe leaves, laid them on the dish and brought them to the young lady,\r\nsaying, ‘I bring you the dish myself that you may not wait any longer.’\r\nSo she ate of it, and like the others ran off into the court braying\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThen the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that they\r\nmight know him. ‘Now you shall be paid for your roguery,’ said he; and\r\ntied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till he\r\ncame to a mill and knocked at the window. ‘What’s the matter?’ said the\r\nmiller. ‘I have three tiresome beasts here,’ said the other; ‘if you\r\nwill take them, give them food and room, and treat them as I tell you,\r\nI will pay you whatever you ask.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said the miller;\r\n‘but how shall I treat them?’ Then the huntsman said, ‘Give the old\r\none stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who was\r\nthe servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give\r\nthe youngest (who was the beautiful lady) hay three times a day and\r\nno stripes’: for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten.\r\nAfter this he went back to the castle, where he found everything he\r\nwanted.\r\n\r\nSome days after, the miller came to him and told him that the old ass\r\nwas dead; ‘The other two,’ said he, ‘are alive and eat, but are so\r\nsorrowful that they cannot last long.’ Then the huntsman pitied them,\r\nand told the miller to drive them back to him, and when they came, he\r\ngave them some of the good salad to eat. And the beautiful young lady\r\nfell upon her knees before him, and said, ‘O dearest huntsman! forgive\r\nme all the ill I have done you; my mother forced me to it, it was\r\nagainst my will, for I always loved you very much. Your wishing-cloak\r\nhangs up in the closet, and as for the bird’s heart, I will give it you\r\ntoo.’ But he said, ‘Keep it, it will be just the same thing, for I mean\r\nto make you my wife.’ So they were married, and lived together very\r\nhappily till they died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE YOUTH WHO WENT FORTH TO LEARN WHAT FEAR WAS\r\n\r\n\r\nA certain father had two sons, the elder of who was smart and sensible,\r\nand could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither\r\nlearn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said:\r\n‘There’s a fellow who will give his father some trouble!’ When anything\r\nhad to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but\r\nif his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the\r\nnight-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal\r\nplace, he answered: ‘Oh, no father, I’ll not go there, it makes me\r\nshudder!’ for he was afraid. Or when stories were told by the fire at\r\nnight which made the flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said: ‘Oh,\r\nit makes us shudder!’ The younger sat in a corner and listened with\r\nthe rest of them, and could not imagine what they could mean. ‘They are\r\nalways saying: “It makes me shudder, it makes me shudder!” It does not\r\nmake me shudder,’ thought he. ‘That, too, must be an art of which I\r\nunderstand nothing!’\r\n\r\nNow it came to pass that his father said to him one day: ‘Hearken to me,\r\nyou fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong, and you\r\ntoo must learn something by which you can earn your bread. Look how your\r\nbrother works, but you do not even earn your salt.’ ‘Well, father,’ he\r\nreplied, ‘I am quite willing to learn something--indeed, if it could but\r\nbe managed, I should like to learn how to shudder. I don’t understand\r\nthat at all yet.’ The elder brother smiled when he heard that, and\r\nthought to himself: ‘Goodness, what a blockhead that brother of mine is!\r\nHe will never be good for anything as long as he lives! He who wants to\r\nbe a sickle must bend himself betimes.’\r\n\r\nThe father sighed, and answered him: ‘You shall soon learn what it is to\r\nshudder, but you will not earn your bread by that.’\r\n\r\nSoon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the father\r\nbewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backward\r\nin every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing. ‘Just think,’\r\nsaid he, ‘when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he\r\nactually wanted to learn to shudder.’ ‘If that be all,’ replied the\r\nsexton, ‘he can learn that with me. Send him to me, and I will soon\r\npolish him.’ The father was glad to do it, for he thought: ‘It will\r\ntrain the boy a little.’ The sexton therefore took him into his house,\r\nand he had to ring the church bell. After a day or two, the sexton awoke\r\nhim at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into the church tower and\r\nring the bell. ‘You shall soon learn what shuddering is,’ thought he,\r\nand secretly went there before him; and when the boy was at the top of\r\nthe tower and turned round, and was just going to take hold of the bell\r\nrope, he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding\r\nhole. ‘Who is there?’ cried he, but the figure made no reply, and did\r\nnot move or stir. ‘Give an answer,’ cried the boy, ‘or take yourself\r\noff, you have no business here at night.’\r\n\r\nThe sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might\r\nthink he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time: ‘What do you want\r\nhere?--speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the\r\nsteps!’ The sexton thought: ‘He can’t mean to be as bad as his words,’\r\nuttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boy\r\ncalled to him for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose,\r\nhe ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell\r\ndown the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon he\r\nrang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went to bed, and\r\nfell asleep. The sexton’s wife waited a long time for her husband, but\r\nhe did not come back. At length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy,\r\nand asked: ‘Do you know where my husband is? He climbed up the tower\r\nbefore you did.’ ‘No, I don’t know,’ replied the boy, ‘but someone was\r\nstanding by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps, and as he\r\nwould neither give an answer nor go away, I took him for a scoundrel,\r\nand threw him downstairs. Just go there and you will see if it was he.\r\nI should be sorry if it were.’ The woman ran away and found her husband,\r\nwho was lying moaning in the corner, and had broken his leg.\r\n\r\nShe carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the\r\nboy’s father, ‘Your boy,’ cried she, ‘has been the cause of a great\r\nmisfortune! He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his\r\nleg. Take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.’ The father was\r\nterrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy. ‘What wicked tricks\r\nare these?’ said he. ‘The devil must have put them into your head.’\r\n‘Father,’ he replied, ‘do listen to me. I am quite innocent. He was\r\nstanding there by night like one intent on doing evil. I did not know\r\nwho it was, and I entreated him three times either to speak or to go\r\naway.’ ‘Ah,’ said the father, ‘I have nothing but unhappiness with you.\r\nGo out of my sight. I will see you no more.’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day. Then will I\r\ngo forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate,\r\nunderstand one art which will support me.’ ‘Learn what you will,’ spoke\r\nthe father, ‘it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers for you.\r\nTake these and go into the wide world, and tell no one from whence you\r\ncome, and who is your father, for I have reason to be ashamed of you.’\r\n‘Yes, father, it shall be as you will. If you desire nothing more than\r\nthat, I can easily keep it in mind.’\r\n\r\nWhen the day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into his\r\npocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to\r\nhimself: ‘If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!’ Then a man\r\napproached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with\r\nhimself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could\r\nsee the gallows, the man said to him: ‘Look, there is the tree where\r\nseven men have married the ropemaker’s daughter, and are now learning\r\nhow to fly. Sit down beneath it, and wait till night comes, and you will\r\nsoon learn how to shudder.’ ‘If that is all that is wanted,’ answered\r\nthe youth, ‘it is easily done; but if I learn how to shudder as fast as\r\nthat, you shall have my fifty talers. Just come back to me early in the\r\nmorning.’ Then the youth went to the gallows, sat down beneath it, and\r\nwaited till evening came. And as he was cold, he lighted himself a fire,\r\nbut at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire, he\r\ncould not get warm. And as the wind knocked the hanged men against each\r\nother, and they moved backwards and forwards, he thought to himself:\r\n‘If you shiver below by the fire, how those up above must freeze and\r\nsuffer!’ And as he felt pity for them, he raised the ladder, and climbed\r\nup, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven.\r\nThen he stoked the fire, blew it, and set them all round it to warm\r\nthemselves. But they sat there and did not stir, and the fire caught\r\ntheir clothes. So he said: ‘Take care, or I will hang you up again.’ The\r\ndead men, however, did not hear, but were quite silent, and let their\r\nrags go on burning. At this he grew angry, and said: ‘If you will not\r\ntake care, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with you,’ and he hung\r\nthem up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his fire and fell\r\nasleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have\r\nthe fifty talers, and said: ‘Well do you know how to shudder?’ ‘No,’\r\nanswered he, ‘how should I know? Those fellows up there did not open\r\ntheir mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which\r\nthey had on their bodies get burnt.’ Then the man saw that he would not\r\nget the fifty talers that day, and went away saying: ‘Such a youth has\r\nnever come my way before.’\r\n\r\nThe youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to\r\nhimself: ‘Ah, if I could but shudder! Ah, if I could but shudder!’ A\r\nwaggoner who was striding behind him heard this and asked: ‘Who are\r\nyou?’ ‘I don’t know,’ answered the youth. Then the waggoner asked: ‘From\r\nwhence do you come?’ ‘I know not.’ ‘Who is your father?’ ‘That I may\r\nnot tell you.’ ‘What is it that you are always muttering between your\r\nteeth?’ ‘Ah,’ replied the youth, ‘I do so wish I could shudder, but\r\nno one can teach me how.’ ‘Enough of your foolish chatter,’ said the\r\nwaggoner. ‘Come, go with me, I will see about a place for you.’ The\r\nyouth went with the waggoner, and in the evening they arrived at an inn\r\nwhere they wished to pass the night. Then at the entrance of the parlour\r\nthe youth again said quite loudly: ‘If I could but shudder! If I could\r\nbut shudder!’ The host who heard this, laughed and said: ‘If that is\r\nyour desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.’ ‘Ah,\r\nbe silent,’ said the hostess, ‘so many prying persons have already lost\r\ntheir lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as\r\nthese should never see the daylight again.’\r\n\r\nBut the youth said: ‘However difficult it may be, I will learn it. For\r\nthis purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.’ He let the host have\r\nno rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a\r\nhaunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was,\r\nif he would but watch in it for three nights. The king had promised that\r\nhe who would venture should have his daughter to wife, and she was the\r\nmost beautiful maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in the castle lay great\r\ntreasures, which were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would\r\nthen be freed, and would make a poor man rich enough. Already many men\r\nhad gone into the castle, but as yet none had come out again. Then the\r\nyouth went next morning to the king, and said: ‘If it be allowed, I will\r\nwillingly watch three nights in the haunted castle.’\r\n\r\nThe king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said: ‘You may\r\nask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must\r\nbe things without life.’ Then he answered: ‘Then I ask for a fire, a\r\nturning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.’\r\n\r\nThe king had these things carried into the castle for him during the\r\nday. When night was drawing near, the youth went up and made himself\r\na bright fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife\r\nbeside it, and seated himself by the turning-lathe. ‘Ah, if I could\r\nbut shudder!’ said he, ‘but I shall not learn it here either.’ Towards\r\nmidnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it,\r\nsomething cried suddenly from one corner: ‘Au, miau! how cold we are!’\r\n‘You fools!’ cried he, ‘what are you crying about? If you are cold, come\r\nand take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.’ And when he had said\r\nthat, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down\r\non each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery\r\neyes. After a short time, when they had warmed themselves, they said:\r\n‘Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?’ ‘Why not?’ he replied, ‘but\r\njust show me your paws.’ Then they stretched out their claws. ‘Oh,’ said\r\nhe, ‘what long nails you have! Wait, I must first cut them for you.’\r\nThereupon he seized them by the throats, put them on the cutting-board\r\nand screwed their feet fast. ‘I have looked at your fingers,’ said he,\r\n‘and my fancy for card-playing has gone,’ and he struck them dead and\r\nthrew them out into the water. But when he had made away with these two,\r\nand was about to sit down again by his fire, out from every hole and\r\ncorner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains, and more\r\nand more of them came until he could no longer move, and they yelled\r\nhorribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to put\r\nit out. He watched them for a while quietly, but at last when they were\r\ngoing too far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried: ‘Away with you,\r\nvermin,’ and began to cut them down. Some of them ran away, the others\r\nhe killed, and threw out into the fish-pond. When he came back he fanned\r\nthe embers of his fire again and warmed himself. And as he thus sat, his\r\neyes would keep open no longer, and he felt a desire to sleep. Then he\r\nlooked round and saw a great bed in the corner. ‘That is the very thing\r\nfor me,’ said he, and got into it. When he was just going to shut his\r\neyes, however, the bed began to move of its own accord, and went over\r\nthe whole of the castle. ‘That’s right,’ said he, ‘but go faster.’ Then\r\nthe bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down,\r\nover thresholds and stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside\r\ndown, and lay on him like a mountain. But he threw quilts and pillows up\r\nin the air, got out and said: ‘Now anyone who likes, may drive,’ and\r\nlay down by his fire, and slept till it was day. In the morning the king\r\ncame, and when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the evil\r\nspirits had killed him and he was dead. Then said he: ‘After all it is a\r\npity,--for so handsome a man.’ The youth heard it, got up, and said: ‘It\r\nhas not come to that yet.’ Then the king was astonished, but very glad,\r\nand asked how he had fared. ‘Very well indeed,’ answered he; ‘one\r\nnight is past, the two others will pass likewise.’ Then he went to the\r\ninnkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said: ‘I never expected to\r\nsee you alive again! Have you learnt how to shudder yet?’ ‘No,’ said he,\r\n‘it is all in vain. If someone would but tell me!’\r\n\r\nThe second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by the\r\nfire, and once more began his old song: ‘If I could but shudder!’ When\r\nmidnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at\r\nfirst it was low, but it grew louder and louder. Then it was quiet for\r\na while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the\r\nchimney and fell before him. ‘Hullo!’ cried he, ‘another half belongs\r\nto this. This is not enough!’ Then the uproar began again, there was a\r\nroaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise. ‘Wait,’ said\r\nhe, ‘I will just stoke up the fire a little for you.’ When he had done\r\nthat and looked round again, the two pieces were joined together, and a\r\nhideous man was sitting in his place. ‘That is no part of our bargain,’\r\nsaid the youth, ‘the bench is mine.’ The man wanted to push him away;\r\nthe youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him off with all\r\nhis strength, and seated himself again in his own place. Then still more\r\nmen fell down, one after the other; they brought nine dead men’s legs\r\nand two skulls, and set them up and played at nine-pins with them. The\r\nyouth also wanted to play and said: ‘Listen you, can I join you?’ ‘Yes,\r\nif you have any money.’ ‘Money enough,’ replied he, ‘but your balls are\r\nnot quite round.’ Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and\r\nturned them till they were round. ‘There, now they will roll better!’\r\nsaid he. ‘Hurrah! now we’ll have fun!’ He played with them and lost some\r\nof his money, but when it struck twelve, everything vanished from his\r\nsight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep. Next morning the king came\r\nto inquire after him. ‘How has it fared with you this time?’ asked he.\r\n‘I have been playing at nine-pins,’ he answered, ‘and have lost a couple\r\nof farthings.’ ‘Have you not shuddered then?’ ‘What?’ said he, ‘I have\r\nhad a wonderful time! If I did but know what it was to shudder!’\r\n\r\nThe third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly:\r\n‘If I could but shudder.’ When it grew late, six tall men came in and\r\nbrought a coffin. Then he said: ‘Ha, ha, that is certainly my little\r\ncousin, who died only a few days ago,’ and he beckoned with his finger,\r\nand cried: ‘Come, little cousin, come.’ They placed the coffin on the\r\nground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay\r\ntherein. He felt his face, but it was cold as ice. ‘Wait,’ said he, ‘I\r\nwill warm you a little,’ and went to the fire and warmed his hand and\r\nlaid it on the dead man’s face, but he remained cold. Then he took him\r\nout, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his\r\narms that the blood might circulate again. As this also did no good, he\r\nthought to himself: ‘When two people lie in bed together, they warm each\r\nother,’ and carried him to the bed, covered him over and lay down by\r\nhim. After a short time the dead man became warm too, and began to move.\r\nThen said the youth, ‘See, little cousin, have I not warmed you?’ The\r\ndead man, however, got up and cried: ‘Now will I strangle you.’\r\n\r\n‘What!’ said he, ‘is that the way you thank me? You shall at once go\r\ninto your coffin again,’ and he took him up, threw him into it, and shut\r\nthe lid. Then came the six men and carried him away again. ‘I cannot\r\nmanage to shudder,’ said he. ‘I shall never learn it here as long as I\r\nlive.’\r\n\r\nThen a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible.\r\nHe was old, however, and had a long white beard. ‘You wretch,’ cried he,\r\n‘you shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for you shall die.’ ‘Not so\r\nfast,’ replied the youth. ‘If I am to die, I shall have to have a say\r\nin it.’ ‘I will soon seize you,’ said the fiend. ‘Softly, softly, do not\r\ntalk so big. I am as strong as you are, and perhaps even stronger.’\r\n‘We shall see,’ said the old man. ‘If you are stronger, I will let you\r\ngo--come, we will try.’ Then he led him by dark passages to a smith’s\r\nforge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground.\r\n‘I can do better than that,’ said the youth, and went to the other\r\nanvil. The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his\r\nwhite beard hung down. Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil\r\nwith one blow, and in it caught the old man’s beard. ‘Now I have you,’\r\nsaid the youth. ‘Now it is your turn to die.’ Then he seized an iron bar\r\nand beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop, when he\r\nwould give him great riches. The youth drew out the axe and let him go.\r\nThe old man led him back into the castle, and in a cellar showed him\r\nthree chests full of gold. ‘Of these,’ said he, ‘one part is for the\r\npoor, the other for the king, the third yours.’ In the meantime it\r\nstruck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so that the youth stood in\r\ndarkness. ‘I shall still be able to find my way out,’ said he, and felt\r\nabout, found the way into the room, and slept there by his fire.\r\nNext morning the king came and said: ‘Now you must have learnt what\r\nshuddering is?’ ‘No,’ he answered; ‘what can it be? My dead cousin was\r\nhere, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down\r\nbelow, but no one told me what it was to shudder.’ ‘Then,’ said the\r\nking, ‘you have saved the castle, and shall marry my daughter.’ ‘That\r\nis all very well,’ said he, ‘but still I do not know what it is to\r\nshudder!’\r\n\r\nThen the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever\r\nmuch the young king loved his wife, and however happy he was, he still\r\nsaid always: ‘If I could but shudder--if I could but shudder.’ And this\r\nat last angered her. Her waiting-maid said: ‘I will find a cure for him;\r\nhe shall soon learn what it is to shudder.’ She went out to the stream\r\nwhich flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons\r\nbrought to her. At night when the young king was sleeping, his wife was\r\nto draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold water\r\nwith the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes would\r\nsprawl about him. Then he woke up and cried: ‘Oh, what makes me shudder\r\nso?--what makes me shudder so, dear wife? Ah! now I know what it is to\r\nshudder!’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKING GRISLY-BEARD\r\n\r\n\r\nA great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very\r\nbeautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the\r\nprinces who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she\r\nonly made sport of them.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all\r\nher suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their\r\nrank--kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons,\r\nand knights. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she\r\nhad something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: ‘He’s\r\nas round as a tub,’ said she. The next was too tall: ‘What a maypole!’\r\nsaid she. The next was too short: ‘What a dumpling!’ said she. The\r\nfourth was too pale, and she called him ‘Wallface.’ The fifth was too\r\nred, so she called him ‘Coxcomb.’ The sixth was not straight enough;\r\nso she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over\r\na baker’s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but\r\nshe laughed more than all at a good king who was there. ‘Look at\r\nhim,’ said she; ‘his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called\r\nGrisly-beard.’ So the king got the nickname of Grisly-beard.\r\n\r\nBut the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved,\r\nand how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or\r\nunwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that\r\ncame to the door.\r\n\r\nTwo days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play\r\nunder the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said,\r\n‘Let him come in.’ So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when\r\nhe had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the\r\nking said, ‘You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for\r\nyour wife.’ The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, ‘I have\r\nsworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.’ So words\r\nand tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married\r\nto the fiddler. When this was over the king said, ‘Now get ready to\r\ngo--you must not stay here--you must travel on with your husband.’\r\n\r\nThen the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came\r\nto a great wood. ‘Pray,’ said she, ‘whose is this wood?’ ‘It belongs\r\nto King Grisly-beard,’ answered he; ‘hadst thou taken him, all had been\r\nthine.’ ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘would that I had\r\nmarried King Grisly-beard!’ Next they came to some fine meadows. ‘Whose\r\nare these beautiful green meadows?’ said she. ‘They belong to King\r\nGrisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.’ ‘Ah!\r\nunlucky wretch that I am!’ said she; ‘would that I had married King\r\nGrisly-beard!’\r\n\r\nThen they came to a great city. ‘Whose is this noble city?’ said she.\r\n‘It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been\r\nthine.’ ‘Ah! wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘why did I not marry King\r\nGrisly-beard?’ ‘That is no business of mine,’ said the fiddler: ‘why\r\nshould you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough for you?’\r\n\r\nAt last they came to a small cottage. ‘What a paltry place!’ said she;\r\n‘to whom does that little dirty hole belong?’ Then the fiddler said,\r\n‘That is your and my house, where we are to live.’ ‘Where are your\r\nservants?’ cried she. ‘What do we want with servants?’ said he; ‘you\r\nmust do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put\r\non water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.’ But the princess knew\r\nnothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help\r\nher. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the\r\nfiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus\r\nthey lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the\r\ncottage, the man said, ‘Wife, we can’t go on thus, spending money and\r\nearning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.’ Then he went out and\r\ncut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made\r\nher fingers very sore. ‘I see this work won’t do,’ said he: ‘try and\r\nspin; perhaps you will do that better.’ So she sat down and tried to\r\nspin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. ‘See\r\nnow,’ said the fiddler, ‘you are good for nothing; you can do no work:\r\nwhat a bargain I have got! However, I’ll try and set up a trade in pots\r\nand pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.’ ‘Alas!’\r\nsighed she, ‘if any of my father’s court should pass by and see me\r\nstanding in the market, how they will laugh at me!’\r\n\r\nBut her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she\r\ndid not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many\r\npeople, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid\r\ntheir money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on\r\nthis as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of\r\nware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but\r\na drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall,\r\nand broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry,\r\nand knew not what to do. ‘Ah! what will become of me?’ said she; ‘what\r\nwill my husband say?’ So she ran home and told him all. ‘Who would\r\nhave thought you would have been so silly,’ said he, ‘as to put an\r\nearthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes?\r\nbut let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this sort of\r\nwork, so I have been to the king’s palace, and asked if they did not\r\nwant a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will\r\nhave plenty to eat.’\r\n\r\nThus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all\r\nthe dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat\r\nthat was left, and on this they lived.\r\n\r\nShe had not been there long before she heard that the king’s eldest son\r\nwas passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows\r\nand looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of\r\nthe court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly\r\nwhich had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich\r\nmeats, which she put into her basket to take home.\r\n\r\nAll on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king’s son in golden\r\nclothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her\r\nby the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she\r\ntrembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was\r\nmaking sport of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the\r\ncover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then\r\neverybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she\r\nwished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the\r\ndoor to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and\r\nbrought her back and said, ‘Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived\r\nwith you in the hut. I brought you there because I really loved you. I\r\nam also the soldier that overset your stall. I have done all this only\r\nto cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your\r\nill-treatment of me. Now all is over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is\r\ntime to hold our marriage feast.’\r\n\r\nThen the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and\r\nher father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home\r\non her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was\r\ngrand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you\r\nand I had been of the party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRON HANS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his\r\npalace, full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out a\r\nhuntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back. ‘Perhaps some\r\naccident has befallen him,’ said the king, and the next day he sent out\r\ntwo more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they too stayed away.\r\nThen on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said: ‘Scour\r\nthe whole forest through, and do not give up until you have found all\r\nthree.’ But of these also, none came home again, none were seen again.\r\nFrom that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest,\r\nand it lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen\r\nof it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it. This lasted for\r\nmany years, when an unknown huntsman announced himself to the king as\r\nseeking a situation, and offered to go into the dangerous forest. The\r\nking, however, would not give his consent, and said: ‘It is not safe in\r\nthere; I fear it would fare with you no better than with the others,\r\nand you would never come out again.’ The huntsman replied: ‘Lord, I will\r\nventure it at my own risk, of fear I know nothing.’\r\n\r\nThe huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It was\r\nnot long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to\r\npursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a\r\ndeep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of\r\nthe water, seized it, and drew it under. When the huntsman saw that, he\r\nwent back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the\r\nwater. When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body\r\nwas brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his\r\nknees. They bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle. There\r\nwas great astonishment over the wild man; the king, however, had him put\r\nin an iron cage in his courtyard, and forbade the door to be opened\r\non pain of death, and the queen herself was to take the key into her\r\nkeeping. And from this time forth everyone could again go into the\r\nforest with safety.\r\n\r\nThe king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the\r\ncourtyard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage.\r\nThe boy ran thither and said: ‘Give me my ball out.’ ‘Not till you have\r\nopened the door for me,’ answered the man. ‘No,’ said the boy, ‘I will\r\nnot do that; the king has forbidden it,’ and ran away. The next day he\r\nagain went and asked for his ball; the wild man said: ‘Open my door,’\r\nbut the boy would not. On the third day the king had ridden out hunting,\r\nand the boy went once more and said: ‘I cannot open the door even if I\r\nwished, for I have not the key.’ Then the wild man said: ‘It lies under\r\nyour mother’s pillow, you can get it there.’ The boy, who wanted to have\r\nhis ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key. The\r\ndoor opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers. When it\r\nwas open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried\r\naway. The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him: ‘Oh,\r\nwild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!’ The wild man turned\r\nback, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps\r\ninto the forest. When the king came home, he observed the empty cage,\r\nand asked the queen how that had happened. She knew nothing about it,\r\nand sought the key, but it was gone. She called the boy, but no one\r\nanswered. The king sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but\r\nthey did not find him. Then he could easily guess what had happened, and\r\nmuch grief reigned in the royal court.\r\n\r\nWhen the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy\r\ndown from his shoulder, and said to him: ‘You will never see your father\r\nand mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free,\r\nand I have compassion on you. If you do all I bid you, you shall fare\r\nwell. Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the\r\nworld.’ He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept, and the\r\nnext morning the man took him to a well, and said: ‘Behold, the gold\r\nwell is as bright and clear as crystal, you shall sit beside it, and\r\ntake care that nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted. I will\r\ncome every evening to see if you have obeyed my order.’ The boy placed\r\nhimself by the brink of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a\r\ngolden snake show itself therein, and took care that nothing fell in.\r\nAs he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he\r\ninvoluntarily put it in the water. He drew it quickly out again, but saw\r\nthat it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold\r\noff again, all was to no purpose. In the evening Iron Hans came back,\r\nlooked at the boy, and said: ‘What has happened to the well?’ ‘Nothing\r\nnothing,’ he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the\r\nman might not see it. But he said: ‘You have dipped your finger into\r\nthe water, this time it may pass, but take care you do not again let\r\nanything go in.’ By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and\r\nwatching it. His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head,\r\nand then unhappily a hair fell down into the well. He took it quickly\r\nout, but it was already quite gilded. Iron Hans came, and already knew\r\nwhat had happened. ‘You have let a hair fall into the well,’ said he.\r\n‘I will allow you to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the\r\nthird time then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain with\r\nme.’\r\n\r\nOn the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger,\r\nhowever much it hurt him. But the time was long to him, and he looked at\r\nthe reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as he\r\nstill bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look\r\nstraight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into\r\nthe water. He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of\r\nhis head was already golden and shone like the sun. You can imagine how\r\nterrified the poor boy was! He took his pocket-handkerchief and tied it\r\nround his head, in order that the man might not see it. When he came he\r\nalready knew everything, and said: ‘Take the handkerchief off.’ Then the\r\ngolden hair streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might,\r\nit was of no use. ‘You have not stood the trial and can stay here no\r\nlonger. Go forth into the world, there you will learn what poverty is.\r\nBut as you have not a bad heart, and as I mean well by you, there is\r\none thing I will grant you; if you fall into any difficulty, come to the\r\nforest and cry: “Iron Hans,” and then I will come and help you. My\r\npower is great, greater than you think, and I have gold and silver in\r\nabundance.’\r\n\r\nThen the king’s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten\r\npaths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he\r\nlooked for work, but could find none, and he learnt nothing by which he\r\ncould help himself. At length he went to the palace, and asked if they\r\nwould take him in. The people about court did not at all know what use\r\nthey could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay. At\r\nlength the cook took him into his service, and said he might carry wood\r\nand water, and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened that\r\nno one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the\r\nroyal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he\r\nkept his little cap on. Such a thing as that had never yet come under\r\nthe king’s notice, and he said: ‘When you come to the royal table you\r\nmust take your hat off.’ He answered: ‘Ah, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad\r\nsore place on my head.’ Then the king had the cook called before him\r\nand scolded him, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his\r\nservice; and that he was to send him away at once. The cook, however,\r\nhad pity on him, and exchanged him for the gardener’s boy.\r\n\r\nAnd now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear\r\nthe wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone in\r\nthe garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air\r\nmight cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so\r\nthat the rays fell into the bedroom of the king’s daughter, and up she\r\nsprang to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy, and cried to\r\nhim: ‘Boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.’ He put his cap on with all\r\nhaste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together. When he\r\nwas ascending the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said: ‘How\r\ncan you take the king’s daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go\r\nquickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.’ ‘Oh,\r\nno,’ replied the boy, ‘the wild ones have more scent, and will please\r\nher better.’ When he got into the room, the king’s daughter said: ‘Take\r\nyour cap off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.’ He again\r\nsaid: ‘I may not, I have a sore head.’ She, however, caught at his\r\ncap and pulled it off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his\r\nshoulders, and it was splendid to behold. He wanted to run out, but she\r\nheld him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats. With these he\r\ndeparted, but he cared nothing for the gold pieces. He took them to the\r\ngardener, and said: ‘I present them to your children, they can play with\r\nthem.’ The following day the king’s daughter again called to him that he\r\nwas to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and then he went in with it,\r\nshe instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him,\r\nbut he held it fast with both hands. She again gave him a handful of\r\nducats, but he would not keep them, and gave them to the gardener for\r\nplaythings for his children. On the third day things went just the\r\nsame; she could not get his cap away from him, and he would not have her\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards, the country was overrun by war. The king gathered\r\ntogether his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any\r\nopposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty\r\narmy. Then said the gardener’s boy: ‘I am grown up, and will go to the\r\nwars also, only give me a horse.’ The others laughed, and said: ‘Seek\r\none for yourself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the\r\nstable for you.’ When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and\r\nled the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jib,\r\nhobblety jib; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark\r\nforest. When he came to the outskirts, he called ‘Iron Hans’ three\r\ntimes so loudly that it echoed through the trees. Thereupon the wild man\r\nappeared immediately, and said: ‘What do you desire?’ ‘I want a strong\r\nsteed, for I am going to the wars.’ ‘That you shall have, and still more\r\nthan you ask for.’ Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it\r\nwas not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that\r\nsnorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind\r\nthem followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and\r\ntheir swords flashed in the sun. The youth made over his three-legged\r\nhorse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the\r\nsoldiers. When he got near the battlefield a great part of the king’s\r\nmen had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give\r\nway. Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like\r\na hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him. They\r\nbegan to flee, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there\r\nwas not a single man left. Instead of returning to the king, however, he\r\nconducted his troop by byways back to the forest, and called forth Iron\r\nHans. ‘What do you desire?’ asked the wild man. ‘Take back your horse\r\nand your troops, and give me my three-legged horse again.’ All that he\r\nasked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse. When\r\nthe king returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and\r\nwished him joy of his victory. ‘I am not the one who carried away the\r\nvictory,’ said he, ‘but a strange knight who came to my assistance with\r\nhis soldiers.’ The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was,\r\nbut the king did not know, and said: ‘He followed the enemy, and I did\r\nnot see him again.’ She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but\r\nhe smiled, and said: ‘He has just come home on his three-legged horse,\r\nand the others have been mocking him, and crying: “Here comes our\r\nhobblety jib back again!” They asked, too: “Under what hedge have you\r\nbeen lying sleeping all the time?” So he said: “I did the best of all,\r\nand it would have gone badly without me.” And then he was still more\r\nridiculed.’\r\n\r\nThe king said to his daughter: ‘I will proclaim a great feast that shall\r\nlast for three days, and you shall throw a golden apple. Perhaps the\r\nunknown man will show himself.’ When the feast was announced, the youth\r\nwent out to the forest, and called Iron Hans. ‘What do you desire?’\r\nasked he. ‘That I may catch the king’s daughter’s golden apple.’ ‘It is\r\nas safe as if you had it already,’ said Iron Hans. ‘You shall likewise\r\nhave a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited\r\nchestnut-horse.’ When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took\r\nhis place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one. The king’s\r\ndaughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none\r\nof them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away.\r\n\r\nOn the second day Iron Hans equipped him as a white knight, and gave him\r\na white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and\r\nhe did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. The king grew\r\nangry, and said: ‘That is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell\r\nhis name.’ He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple,\r\nshould go away again they should pursue him, and if he would not come\r\nback willingly, they were to cut him down and stab him.\r\n\r\nOn the third day, he received from Iron Hans a suit of black armour and\r\na black horse, and again he caught the apple. But when he was riding off\r\nwith it, the king’s attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near\r\nhim that he wounded the youth’s leg with the point of his sword. The\r\nyouth nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently\r\nthat the helmet fell from the youth’s head, and they could see that he\r\nhad golden hair. They rode back and announced this to the king.\r\n\r\nThe following day the king’s daughter asked the gardener about his\r\nboy. ‘He is at work in the garden; the queer creature has been at the\r\nfestival too, and only came home yesterday evening; he has likewise\r\nshown my children three golden apples which he has won.’\r\n\r\nThe king had him summoned into his presence, and he came and again had\r\nhis little cap on his head. But the king’s daughter went up to him and\r\ntook it off, and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and\r\nhe was so handsome that all were amazed. ‘Are you the knight who came\r\nevery day to the festival, always in different colours, and who caught\r\nthe three golden apples?’ asked the king. ‘Yes,’ answered he, ‘and here\r\nthe apples are,’ and he took them out of his pocket, and returned them\r\nto the king. ‘If you desire further proof, you may see the wound which\r\nyour people gave me when they followed me. But I am likewise the knight\r\nwho helped you to your victory over your enemies.’ ‘If you can perform\r\nsuch deeds as that, you are no gardener’s boy; tell me, who is your\r\nfather?’ ‘My father is a mighty king, and gold have I in plenty as great\r\nas I require.’ ‘I well see,’ said the king, ‘that I owe my thanks to\r\nyou; can I do anything to please you?’ ‘Yes,’ answered he, ‘that indeed\r\nyou can. Give me your daughter to wife.’ The maiden laughed, and said:\r\n‘He does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his\r\ngolden hair that he was no gardener’s boy,’ and then she went and\r\nkissed him. His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great\r\ndelight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear\r\nson again. And as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music\r\nsuddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a stately king came in with a\r\ngreat retinue. He went up to the youth, embraced him and said: ‘I am\r\nIron Hans, and was by enchantment a wild man, but you have set me free;\r\nall the treasures which I possess, shall be your property.’\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAT-SKIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and was\r\nso beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of\r\nthe earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her\r\nend drew near she called the king to her and said, ‘Promise me that you\r\nwill never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful\r\nas I am, and who has golden hair like mine.’ Then when the king in his\r\ngrief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died. But the king\r\nwas not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking\r\nanother wife. At last, however, his wise men said, ‘this will not do;\r\nthe king must marry again, that we may have a queen.’ So messengers were\r\nsent far and wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen.\r\nBut there was no princess in the world so beautiful; and if there had\r\nbeen, still there was not one to be found who had golden hair. So the\r\nmessengers came home, and had had all their trouble for nothing.\r\n\r\nNow the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother,\r\nand had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up, the king looked\r\nat her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to\r\nhis courtiers, ‘May I not marry my daughter? She is the very image of my\r\ndead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole\r\nearth, and you say there must be a queen.’ When the courtiers heard this\r\nthey were shocked, and said, ‘Heaven forbid that a father should marry\r\nhis daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can come.’ And his daughter\r\nwas also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts;\r\nso she said to him, ‘Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses:\r\none must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver,\r\nlike the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this,\r\nI want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to\r\nwhich every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin.’ And thus\r\nshe thought he would think of the matter no more. But the king made the\r\nmost skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden,\r\nlike the sun; another silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling,\r\nlike the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in\r\nhis kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a\r\nmantle of a thousand furs was made.\r\n\r\nWhen all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the\r\nnight when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden\r\nring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three\r\ndresses--of the sun, the moon, and the stars--up in a nutshell, and\r\nwrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared\r\nher face and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon Heaven for\r\nhelp in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till\r\nat last she came to a large wood. As she was very tired, she sat herself\r\ndown in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and there she slept\r\non till it was midday.\r\n\r\nNow as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs\r\ncame to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and\r\nbark. ‘Look sharp!’ said the king to the huntsmen, ‘and see what sort\r\nof game lies there.’ And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they\r\ncame back again said, ‘In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful\r\nbeast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand\r\nkinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep.’ ‘See,’ said the king, ‘if\r\nyou can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.’ So the huntsmen\r\ntook it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said,\r\n‘I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left; have pity on\r\nme and take me with you.’ Then they said, ‘Yes, Miss Cat-skin, you will\r\ndo for the kitchen; you can sweep up the ashes, and do things of that\r\nsort.’ So they put her into the coach, and took her home to the king’s\r\npalace. Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase, where\r\nno light of day ever peeped in, and said, ‘Cat-skin, you may lie and\r\nsleep there.’ And she was sent into the kitchen, and made to fetch wood\r\nand water, to blow the fire, pluck the poultry, pick the herbs, sift the\r\nashes, and do all the dirty work.\r\n\r\nThus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. ‘Ah! pretty\r\nprincess!’ thought she, ‘what will now become of thee?’ But it happened\r\none day that a feast was to be held in the king’s castle, so she said to\r\nthe cook, ‘May I go up a little while and see what is going on? I will\r\ntake care and stand behind the door.’ And the cook said, ‘Yes, you may\r\ngo, but be back again in half an hour’s time, to rake out the ashes.’\r\nThen she took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the\r\nfur skin, and washed the soot from off her face and hands, so that her\r\nbeauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened\r\nher nutshell, and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun,\r\nand so went to the feast. Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew\r\nher, and they thought she could be no less than a king’s daughter. But\r\nthe king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and\r\nhe thought in his heart, ‘I never saw any one half so beautiful.’\r\n\r\nWhen the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked\r\nround for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood\r\nat the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth\r\nwas, that she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress,\r\nblackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was\r\nCat-skin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began\r\nto rake the ashes, the cook said, ‘Let that alone till the morning, and\r\nheat the king’s soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but\r\ntake care you don’t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of\r\nnever eating again.’\r\n\r\nAs soon as the cook went away, Cat-skin heated the king’s soup, and\r\ntoasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when it\r\nwas ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ring,\r\nand put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was over,\r\nthe king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well,\r\nthat he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom\r\nhe saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got\r\nthere, he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened when\r\nhe heard the order, and said to Cat-skin, ‘You must have let a hair fall\r\ninto the soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating.’ Then he went\r\nbefore the king, and he asked him who had cooked the soup. ‘I did,’\r\nanswered the cook. But the king said, ‘That is not true; it was better\r\ndone than you could do it.’ Then he answered, ‘To tell the truth I did\r\nnot cook it, but Cat-skin did.’ ‘Then let Cat-skin come up,’ said the\r\nking: and when she came he said to her, ‘Who are you?’ ‘I am a poor\r\nchild,’ said she, ‘that has lost both father and mother.’ ‘How came you\r\nin my palace?’ asked he. ‘I am good for nothing,’ said she, ‘but to be\r\nscullion-girl, and to have boots and shoes thrown at my head.’ ‘But how\r\ndid you get the ring that was in the soup?’ asked the king. Then she\r\nwould not own that she knew anything about the ring; so the king sent\r\nher away again about her business.\r\n\r\nAfter a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook to let\r\nher go up and see it as before. ‘Yes,’ said he, ‘but come again in half\r\nan hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.’ Then she\r\nran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress\r\nout which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in,\r\nlooking like a king’s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at\r\nseeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her. After the\r\ndance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the king did\r\nnot see where she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin, and\r\nmade herself into Cat-skin again, and went into the kitchen to cook the\r\nsoup. Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got the golden necklace and\r\ndropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king, who ate it,\r\nand it pleased him as well as before; so he sent for the cook, who\r\nwas again forced to tell him that Cat-skin had cooked it. Cat-skin was\r\nbrought again before the king, but she still told him that she was only\r\nfit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head.\r\n\r\nBut when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third\r\ntime, it happened just the same as before. ‘You must be a witch,\r\nCat-skin,’ said the cook; ‘for you always put something into your soup,\r\nso that it pleases the king better than mine.’ However, he let her go up\r\nas before. Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and\r\nwent into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and\r\nthought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then. So whilst\r\nhe was dancing with her, he put a gold ring on her finger without her\r\nseeing it, and ordered that the dance should be kept up a long time.\r\nWhen it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the hand, but she\r\nslipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sight\r\nof her: and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin under\r\nthe stairs. But this time she kept away too long, and stayed beyond the\r\nhalf-hour; so she had not time to take off her fine dress, and threw her\r\nfur mantle over it, and in her haste did not blacken herself all over\r\nwith soot, but left one of her fingers white.\r\n\r\nThen she ran into the kitchen, and cooked the king’s soup; and as soon\r\nas the cook was gone, she put the golden brooch into the dish. When the\r\nking got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and\r\nsoon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst\r\nthey were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and\r\nwhen she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off\r\na little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.\r\n\r\nThen he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and\r\nbeautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she\r\nwashed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the\r\nmost beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said,\r\n‘You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each\r\nother.’ And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever\r\nwas heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSNOW-WHITE AND ROSE-RED\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of\r\nthe cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore\r\nwhite and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the\r\ntwo rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red.\r\nThey were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children\r\nin the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than\r\nRose-red. Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields\r\nseeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home\r\nwith her mother, and helped her with her housework, or read to her when\r\nthere was nothing to do.\r\n\r\nThe two children were so fond of one another that they always held each\r\nother by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said:\r\n‘We will not leave each other,’ Rose-red answered: ‘Never so long as we\r\nlive,’ and their mother would add: ‘What one has she must share with the\r\nother.’\r\n\r\nThey often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no\r\nbeasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little\r\nhare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by\r\ntheir side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon\r\nthe boughs, and sang whatever they knew.\r\n\r\nNo mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest, and\r\nnight came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss,\r\nand slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and did not\r\nworry on their account.\r\n\r\nOnce when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused\r\nthem, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near\r\ntheir bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing\r\nand went into the forest. And when they looked round they found that\r\nthey had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly\r\nhave fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces\r\nfurther. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who\r\nwatches over good children.\r\n\r\nSnow-white and Rose-red kept their mother’s little cottage so neat that\r\nit was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took care\r\nof the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother’s\r\nbed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter\r\nSnow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob. The kettle\r\nwas of brass and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished. In the\r\nevening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said: ‘Go, Snow-white, and\r\nbolt the door,’ and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took\r\nher spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls\r\nlistened as they sat and spun. And close by them lay a lamb upon the\r\nfloor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head\r\nhidden beneath its wings.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, someone\r\nknocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said:\r\n‘Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking\r\nshelter.’ Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a\r\npoor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black\r\nhead within the door.\r\n\r\nRose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered,\r\nand Snow-white hid herself behind her mother’s bed. But the bear began\r\nto speak and said: ‘Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm! I am\r\nhalf-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.’\r\n\r\n‘Poor bear,’ said the mother, ‘lie down by the fire, only take care that\r\nyou do not burn your coat.’ Then she cried: ‘Snow-white, Rose-red, come\r\nout, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.’ So they both came\r\nout, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid\r\nof him. The bear said: ‘Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a\r\nlittle’; so they brought the broom and swept the bear’s hide clean;\r\nand he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and\r\ncomfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played\r\ntricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands,\r\nput their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a\r\nhazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed. But the\r\nbear took it all in good part, only when they were too rough he called\r\nout: ‘Leave me alive, children,\r\n\r\n  Snow-white, Rose-red,\r\n  Will you beat your wooer dead?’\r\n\r\nWhen it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the\r\nbear: ‘You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe from\r\nthe cold and the bad weather.’ As soon as day dawned the two children\r\nlet him out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest.\r\n\r\nHenceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself\r\ndown by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as\r\nmuch as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were\r\nnever fastened until their black friend had arrived.\r\n\r\nWhen spring had come and all outside was green, the bear said one\r\nmorning to Snow-white: ‘Now I must go away, and cannot come back for the\r\nwhole summer.’ ‘Where are you going, then, dear bear?’ asked Snow-white.\r\n‘I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked\r\ndwarfs. In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged\r\nto stay below and cannot work their way through; but now, when the sun\r\nhas thawed and warmed the earth, they break through it, and come out to\r\npry and steal; and what once gets into their hands, and in their caves,\r\ndoes not easily see daylight again.’\r\n\r\nSnow-white was quite sorry at his departure, and as she unbolted the\r\ndoor for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against the bolt\r\nand a piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to Snow-white\r\nas if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about\r\nit. The bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nA short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest\r\nto get firewood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the\r\nground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and\r\nforwards in the grass, but they could not make out what it was. When\r\nthey came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a\r\nsnow-white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught in a\r\ncrevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping about like a dog\r\ntied to a rope, and did not know what to do.\r\n\r\nHe glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried: ‘Why do you\r\nstand there? Can you not come here and help me?’ ‘What are you up to,\r\nlittle man?’ asked Rose-red. ‘You stupid, prying goose!’ answered the\r\ndwarf: ‘I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking.\r\nThe little bit of food that we people get is immediately burnt up with\r\nheavy logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. I had\r\njust driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished;\r\nbut the cursed wedge was too smooth and suddenly sprang out, and the\r\ntree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white\r\nbeard; so now it is tight and I cannot get away, and the silly, sleek,\r\nmilk-faced things laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!’\r\n\r\nThe children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out, it\r\nwas caught too fast. ‘I will run and fetch someone,’ said Rose-red. ‘You\r\nsenseless goose!’ snarled the dwarf; ‘why should you fetch someone? You\r\nare already two too many for me; can you not think of something better?’\r\n‘Don’t be impatient,’ said Snow-white, ‘I will help you,’ and she pulled\r\nher scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay\r\namongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted it\r\nup, grumbling to himself: ‘Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my fine\r\nbeard. Bad luck to you!’ and then he swung the bag upon his back, and\r\nwent off without even once looking at the children.\r\n\r\nSome time afterwards Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish\r\nof fish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a large\r\ngrasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in.\r\nThey ran to it and found it was the dwarf. ‘Where are you going?’ said\r\nRose-red; ‘you surely don’t want to go into the water?’ ‘I am not such\r\na fool!’ cried the dwarf; ‘don’t you see that the accursed fish wants\r\nto pull me in?’ The little man had been sitting there fishing, and\r\nunluckily the wind had tangled up his beard with the fishing-line; a\r\nmoment later a big fish made a bite and the feeble creature had not\r\nstrength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the\r\ndwarf towards him. He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it was of\r\nlittle good, for he was forced to follow the movements of the fish, and\r\nwas in urgent danger of being dragged into the water.\r\n\r\nThe girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his\r\nbeard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled fast\r\ntogether. There was nothing to do but to bring out the scissors and cut\r\nthe beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf saw that\r\nhe screamed out: ‘Is that civil, you toadstool, to disfigure a man’s\r\nface? Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard? Now you have\r\ncut off the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by my people.\r\nI wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!’ Then he took\r\nout a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without another word\r\nhe dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.\r\n\r\nIt happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the\r\ntown to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road led them\r\nacross a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn about. There\r\nthey noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and\r\nround above them; it sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a\r\nrock not far away. Immediately they heard a loud, piteous cry. They ran\r\nup and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance\r\nthe dwarf, and was going to carry him off.\r\n\r\nThe children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man,\r\nand pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go.\r\nAs soon as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried\r\nwith his shrill voice: ‘Could you not have done it more carefully! You\r\ndragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you\r\nclumsy creatures!’ Then he took up a sack full of precious stones, and\r\nslipped away again under the rock into his hole. The girls, who by\r\nthis time were used to his ingratitude, went on their way and did their\r\nbusiness in town.\r\n\r\nAs they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the\r\ndwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot,\r\nand had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening\r\nsun shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and sparkled with\r\nall colours so beautifully that the children stood still and stared\r\nat them. ‘Why do you stand gaping there?’ cried the dwarf, and his\r\nashen-grey face became copper-red with rage. He was still cursing when a\r\nloud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out\r\nof the forest. The dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could not reach\r\nhis cave, for the bear was already close. Then in the dread of his heart\r\nhe cried: ‘Dear Mr Bear, spare me, I will give you all my treasures;\r\nlook, the beautiful jewels lying there! Grant me my life; what do you\r\nwant with such a slender little fellow as I? you would not feel me\r\nbetween your teeth. Come, take these two wicked girls, they are tender\r\nmorsels for you, fat as young quails; for mercy’s sake eat them!’ The\r\nbear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature a single\r\nblow with his paw, and he did not move again.\r\n\r\nThe girls had run away, but the bear called to them: ‘Snow-white and\r\nRose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.’ Then they\r\nrecognized his voice and waited, and when he came up to them suddenly\r\nhis bearskin fell off, and he stood there a handsome man, clothed all in\r\ngold. ‘I am a king’s son,’ he said, ‘and I was bewitched by that wicked\r\ndwarf, who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run about the forest\r\nas a savage bear until I was freed by his death. Now he has got his\r\nwell-deserved punishment.\r\n\r\nSnow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother, and they\r\ndivided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered\r\ntogether in his cave. The old mother lived peacefully and happily with\r\nher children for many years. She took the two rose-trees with her, and\r\nthey stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful\r\nroses, white and red.\r\n\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Brothers Grimm, Jacob (1785-1863) and Wilhelm (1786-1859), were born\r\nin Hanau, near Frankfurt, in the German state of Hesse. Throughout\r\ntheir lives they remained close friends, and both studied law at Marburg\r\nUniversity. Jacob was a pioneer in the study of German philology,\r\nand although Wilhelm’s work was hampered by poor health the brothers\r\ncollaborated in the creation of a German dictionary, not completed until\r\na century after their deaths. But they were best (and universally) known\r\nfor the collection of over two hundred folk tales they made from oral\r\nsources and published in two volumes of ‘Nursery and Household Tales’ in\r\n1812 and 1814. Although their intention was to preserve such material as\r\npart of German cultural and literary history, and their collection was\r\nfirst published with scholarly notes and no illustration, the tales soon\r\ncame into the possession of young readers. This was in part due to Edgar\r\nTaylor, who made the first English translation in 1823, selecting about\r\nfifty stories ‘with the amusement of some young friends principally in\r\nview.’ They have been an essential ingredient of children’s reading ever\r\nsince.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK GRIMMS’ FAIRY TALES ***\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will\r\nbe renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\r\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,\r\nso the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the\r\nUnited States without permission and without paying copyright\r\nroyalties.

The birth of the Prince and the Pauper.\r\n\r\nIn the ancient city of London, on a certain autumn day in the second\r\nquarter of the sixteenth century, a boy was born to a poor family of the\r\nname of Canty, who did not want him.  On the same day another English\r\nchild was born to a rich family of the name of Tudor, who did want him.\r\nAll England wanted him too.  England had so longed for him, and hoped\r\nfor him, and prayed God for him, that, now that he was really come, the\r\npeople went nearly mad for joy.  Mere acquaintances hugged and kissed\r\neach other and cried. Everybody took a holiday, and high and low, rich\r\nand poor, feasted and danced and sang, and got very mellow; and they\r\nkept this up for days and nights together.  By day, London was a sight\r\nto see, with gay banners waving from every balcony and housetop, and\r\nsplendid pageants marching along.  By night, it was again a sight\r\nto see, with its great bonfires at every corner, and its troops of\r\nrevellers making merry around them.  There was no talk in all England\r\nbut of the new baby, Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales, who lay lapped in\r\nsilks and satins, unconscious of all this fuss, and not knowing that\r\ngreat lords and ladies were tending him and watching over him--and not\r\ncaring, either.  But there was no talk about the other baby, Tom Canty,\r\nlapped in his poor rags, except among the family of paupers whom he had\r\njust come to trouble with his presence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. Tom’s early life.\r\n\r\nLet us skip a number of years.\r\n\r\nLondon was fifteen hundred years old, and was a great town--for that\r\nday. It had a hundred thousand inhabitants--some think double as many.\r\n The streets were very narrow, and crooked, and dirty, especially in the\r\npart where Tom Canty lived, which was not far from London Bridge.  The\r\nhouses were of wood, with the second story projecting over the first,\r\nand the third sticking its elbows out beyond the second.  The higher\r\nthe houses grew, the broader they grew.  They were skeletons of strong\r\ncriss-cross beams, with solid material between, coated with plaster.\r\n The beams were painted red or blue or black, according to the owner’s\r\ntaste, and this gave the houses a very picturesque look.  The windows\r\nwere small, glazed with little diamond-shaped panes, and they opened\r\noutward, on hinges, like doors.\r\n\r\nThe house which Tom’s father lived in was up a foul little pocket called\r\nOffal Court, out of Pudding Lane.  It was small, decayed, and rickety,\r\nbut it was packed full of wretchedly poor families. Canty’s tribe\r\noccupied a room on the third floor.  The mother and father had a sort of\r\nbedstead in the corner; but Tom, his grandmother, and his two sisters,\r\nBet and Nan, were not restricted--they had all the floor to themselves,\r\nand might sleep where they chose.  There were the remains of a blanket\r\nor two, and some bundles of ancient and dirty straw, but these could not\r\nrightly be called beds, for they were not organised; they were kicked\r\ninto a general pile, mornings, and selections made from the mass at\r\nnight, for service.\r\n\r\nBet and Nan were fifteen years old--twins.  They were good-hearted\r\ngirls, unclean, clothed in rags, and profoundly ignorant.  Their mother\r\nwas like them.  But the father and the grandmother were a couple of\r\nfiends.  They got drunk whenever they could; then they fought each other\r\nor anybody else who came in the way; they cursed and swore always, drunk\r\nor sober; John Canty was a thief, and his mother a beggar.  They made\r\nbeggars of the children, but failed to make thieves of them.  Among,\r\nbut not of, the dreadful rabble that inhabited the house, was a good old\r\npriest whom the King had turned out of house and home with a pension of\r\na few farthings, and he used to get the children aside and teach them\r\nright ways secretly. Father Andrew also taught Tom a little Latin, and\r\nhow to read and write; and would have done the same with the girls,\r\nbut they were afraid of the jeers of their friends, who could not have\r\nendured such a queer accomplishment in them.\r\n\r\nAll Offal Court was just such another hive as Canty’s house.\r\nDrunkenness, riot and brawling were the order, there, every night and\r\nnearly all night long.  Broken heads were as common as hunger in that\r\nplace.  Yet little Tom was not unhappy.  He had a hard time of it, but\r\ndid not know it.  It was the sort of time that all the Offal Court boys\r\nhad, therefore he supposed it was the correct and comfortable thing.\r\n When he came home empty-handed at night, he knew his father would\r\ncurse him and thrash him first, and that when he was done the awful\r\ngrandmother would do it all over again and improve on it; and that away\r\nin the night his starving mother would slip to him stealthily with any\r\nmiserable scrap or crust she had been able to save for him by going\r\nhungry herself, notwithstanding she was often caught in that sort of\r\ntreason and soundly beaten for it by her husband.\r\n\r\nNo, Tom’s life went along well enough, especially in summer.  He only\r\nbegged just enough to save himself, for the laws against mendicancy were\r\nstringent, and the penalties heavy; so he put in a good deal of his time\r\nlistening to good Father Andrew’s charming old tales and legends\r\nabout giants and fairies, dwarfs and genii, and enchanted castles, and\r\ngorgeous kings and princes.  His head grew to be full of these wonderful\r\nthings, and many a night as he lay in the dark on his scant and\r\noffensive straw, tired, hungry, and smarting from a thrashing, he\r\nunleashed his imagination and soon forgot his aches and pains in\r\ndelicious picturings to himself of the charmed life of a petted prince\r\nin a regal palace.  One desire came in time to haunt him day and night:\r\n it was to see a real prince, with his own eyes.  He spoke of it once to\r\nsome of his Offal Court comrades; but they jeered him and scoffed him so\r\nunmercifully that he was glad to keep his dream to himself after that.\r\n\r\nHe often read the priest’s old books and got him to explain and enlarge\r\nupon them.  His dreamings and readings worked certain changes in him,\r\nby-and-by.  His dream-people were so fine that he grew to lament his\r\nshabby clothing and his dirt, and to wish to be clean and better clad.\r\n He went on playing in the mud just the same, and enjoying it, too; but,\r\ninstead of splashing around in the Thames solely for the fun of it,\r\nhe began to find an added value in it because of the washings and\r\ncleansings it afforded.\r\n\r\nTom could always find something going on around the Maypole in\r\nCheapside, and at the fairs; and now and then he and the rest of London\r\nhad a chance to see a military parade when some famous unfortunate was\r\ncarried prisoner to the Tower, by land or boat. One summer’s day he saw\r\npoor Anne Askew and three men burned at the stake in Smithfield, and\r\nheard an ex-Bishop preach a sermon to them which did not interest him.\r\nYes, Tom’s life was varied and pleasant enough, on the whole.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by Tom’s reading and dreaming about princely life wrought such a\r\nstrong effect upon him that he began to _act_ the prince, unconsciously.\r\nHis speech and manners became curiously ceremonious and courtly, to the\r\nvast admiration and amusement of his intimates.  But Tom’s influence\r\namong these young people began to grow now, day by day; and in time he\r\ncame to be looked up to, by them, with a sort of wondering awe, as a\r\nsuperior being.  He seemed to know so much! and he could do and say such\r\nmarvellous things! and withal, he was so deep and wise!  Tom’s remarks,\r\nand Tom’s performances, were reported by the boys to their elders; and\r\nthese, also, presently began to discuss Tom Canty, and to regard him\r\nas a most gifted and extraordinary creature.  Full-grown people brought\r\ntheir perplexities to Tom for solution, and were often astonished at the\r\nwit and wisdom of his decisions.  In fact he was become a hero to all\r\nwho knew him except his own family--these, only, saw nothing in him.\r\n\r\nPrivately, after a while, Tom organised a royal court!  He was the\r\nprince; his special comrades were guards, chamberlains, equerries, lords\r\nand ladies in waiting, and the royal family.  Daily the mock prince was\r\nreceived with elaborate ceremonials borrowed by Tom from his romantic\r\nreadings; daily the great affairs of the mimic kingdom were discussed\r\nin the royal council, and daily his mimic highness issued decrees to his\r\nimaginary armies, navies, and viceroyalties.\r\n\r\nAfter which, he would go forth in his rags and beg a few farthings, eat\r\nhis poor crust, take his customary cuffs and abuse, and then stretch\r\nhimself upon his handful of foul straw, and resume his empty grandeurs\r\nin his dreams.\r\n\r\nAnd still his desire to look just once upon a real prince, in the flesh,\r\ngrew upon him, day by day, and week by week, until at last it absorbed\r\nall other desires, and became the one passion of his life.\r\n\r\nOne January day, on his usual begging tour, he tramped despondently up\r\nand down the region round about Mincing Lane and Little East Cheap, hour\r\nafter hour, bare-footed and cold, looking in at cook-shop windows and\r\nlonging for the dreadful pork-pies and other deadly inventions displayed\r\nthere--for to him these were dainties fit for the angels; that is,\r\njudging by the smell, they were--for it had never been his good luck to\r\nown and eat one. There was a cold drizzle of rain; the atmosphere was\r\nmurky; it was a melancholy day.  At night Tom reached home so wet and\r\ntired and hungry that it was not possible for his father and grandmother\r\nto observe his forlorn condition and not be moved--after their fashion;\r\nwherefore they gave him a brisk cuffing at once and sent him to bed.\r\n For a long time his pain and hunger, and the swearing and fighting\r\ngoing on in the building, kept him awake; but at last his thoughts\r\ndrifted away to far, romantic lands, and he fell asleep in the company\r\nof jewelled and gilded princelings who live in vast palaces, and had\r\nservants salaaming before them or flying to execute their orders.  And\r\nthen, as usual, he dreamed that _he_ was a princeling himself.\r\n\r\nAll night long the glories of his royal estate shone upon him; he moved\r\namong great lords and ladies, in a blaze of light, breathing perfumes,\r\ndrinking in delicious music, and answering the reverent obeisances of\r\nthe glittering throng as it parted to make way for him, with here a\r\nsmile, and there a nod of his princely head.\r\n\r\nAnd when he awoke in the morning and looked upon the wretchedness\r\nabout him, his dream had had its usual effect--it had intensified the\r\nsordidness of his surroundings a thousandfold.  Then came bitterness,\r\nand heart-break, and tears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III. Tom’s meeting with the Prince.\r\n\r\nTom got up hungry, and sauntered hungry away, but with his thoughts busy\r\nwith the shadowy splendours of his night’s dreams. He wandered here\r\nand there in the city, hardly noticing where he was going, or what\r\nwas happening around him.  People jostled him, and some gave him rough\r\nspeech; but it was all lost on the musing boy.  By-and-by he found\r\nhimself at Temple Bar, the farthest from home he had ever travelled in\r\nthat direction.  He stopped and considered a moment, then fell into his\r\nimaginings again, and passed on outside the walls of London.  The Strand\r\nhad ceased to be a country-road then, and regarded itself as a street,\r\nbut by a strained construction; for, though there was a tolerably\r\ncompact row of houses on one side of it, there were only some scattered\r\ngreat buildings on the other, these being palaces of rich nobles, with\r\nample and beautiful grounds stretching to the river--grounds that are\r\nnow closely packed with grim acres of brick and stone.\r\n\r\nTom discovered Charing Village presently, and rested himself at the\r\nbeautiful cross built there by a bereaved king of earlier days; then\r\nidled down a quiet, lovely road, past the great cardinal’s\r\nstately palace, toward a far more mighty and majestic palace\r\nbeyond--Westminster. Tom stared in glad wonder at the vast pile of\r\nmasonry, the wide-spreading wings, the frowning bastions and turrets,\r\nthe huge stone gateway, with its gilded bars and its magnificent array\r\nof colossal granite lions, and other the signs and symbols of English\r\nroyalty.  Was the desire of his soul to be satisfied at last?  Here,\r\nindeed, was a king’s palace.  Might he not hope to see a prince now--a\r\nprince of flesh and blood, if Heaven were willing?\r\n\r\nAt each side of the gilded gate stood a living statue--that is to say,\r\nan erect and stately and motionless man-at-arms, clad from head to heel\r\nin shining steel armour.  At a respectful distance were many country\r\nfolk, and people from the city, waiting for any chance glimpse of\r\nroyalty that might offer.  Splendid carriages, with splendid people\r\nin them and splendid servants outside, were arriving and departing by\r\nseveral other noble gateways that pierced the royal enclosure.\r\n\r\nPoor little Tom, in his rags, approached, and was moving slowly and\r\ntimidly past the sentinels, with a beating heart and a rising hope, when\r\nall at once he caught sight through the golden bars of a spectacle that\r\nalmost made him shout for joy.  Within was a comely boy, tanned and\r\nbrown with sturdy outdoor sports and exercises, whose clothing was all\r\nof lovely silks and satins, shining with jewels; at his hip a little\r\njewelled sword and dagger; dainty buskins on his feet, with red heels;\r\nand on his head a jaunty crimson cap, with drooping plumes fastened\r\nwith a great sparkling gem.  Several gorgeous gentlemen stood near--his\r\nservants, without a doubt.  Oh! he was a prince--a prince, a living\r\nprince, a real prince--without the shadow of a question; and the prayer\r\nof the pauper-boy’s heart was answered at last.\r\n\r\nTom’s breath came quick and short with excitement, and his eyes grew big\r\nwith wonder and delight.  Everything gave way in his mind instantly\r\nto one desire:  that was to get close to the prince, and have a good,\r\ndevouring look at him.  Before he knew what he was about, he had his\r\nface against the gate-bars.  The next instant one of the soldiers\r\nsnatched him rudely away, and sent him spinning among the gaping crowd\r\nof country gawks and London idlers.  The soldier said,--\r\n\r\n“Mind thy manners, thou young beggar!”\r\n\r\nThe crowd jeered and laughed; but the young prince sprang to the gate\r\nwith his face flushed, and his eyes flashing with indignation, and cried\r\nout,--\r\n\r\n“How dar’st thou use a poor lad like that?  How dar’st thou use the King\r\nmy father’s meanest subject so?  Open the gates, and let him in!”\r\n\r\nYou should have seen that fickle crowd snatch off their hats then.\r\nYou should have heard them cheer, and shout, “Long live the Prince of\r\nWales!”\r\n\r\nThe soldiers presented arms with their halberds, opened the gates,\r\nand presented again as the little Prince of Poverty passed in, in his\r\nfluttering rags, to join hands with the Prince of Limitless Plenty.\r\n\r\nEdward Tudor said--\r\n\r\n“Thou lookest tired and hungry:  thou’st been treated ill.  Come with\r\nme.”\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen attendants sprang forward to--I don’t know what; interfere,\r\nno doubt.  But they were waved aside with a right royal gesture, and\r\nthey stopped stock still where they were, like so many statues.  Edward\r\ntook Tom to a rich apartment in the palace, which he called his cabinet.\r\n By his command a repast was brought such as Tom had never encountered\r\nbefore except in books.  The prince, with princely delicacy and\r\nbreeding, sent away the servants, so that his humble guest might not be\r\nembarrassed by their critical presence; then he sat near by, and asked\r\nquestions while Tom ate.\r\n\r\n“What is thy name, lad?”\r\n\r\n“Tom Canty, an’ it please thee, sir.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis an odd one.  Where dost live?”\r\n\r\n“In the city, please thee, sir.  Offal Court, out of Pudding Lane.”\r\n\r\n“Offal Court!  Truly ’tis another odd one.  Hast parents?”\r\n\r\n“Parents have I, sir, and a grand-dam likewise that is but indifferently\r\nprecious to me, God forgive me if it be offence to say it--also twin\r\nsisters, Nan and Bet.”\r\n\r\n“Then is thy grand-dam not over kind to thee, I take it?”\r\n\r\n“Neither to any other is she, so please your worship.  She hath a wicked\r\nheart, and worketh evil all her days.”\r\n\r\n“Doth she mistreat thee?”\r\n\r\n“There be times that she stayeth her hand, being asleep or overcome with\r\ndrink; but when she hath her judgment clear again, she maketh it up to\r\nme with goodly beatings.”\r\n\r\nA fierce look came into the little prince’s eyes, and he cried out--\r\n\r\n“What!  Beatings?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, indeed, yes, please you, sir.”\r\n\r\n“_Beatings_!--and thou so frail and little.  Hark ye:  before the night\r\ncome, she shall hie her to the Tower.  The King my father”--\r\n\r\n“In sooth, you forget, sir, her low degree.  The Tower is for the great\r\nalone.”\r\n\r\n“True, indeed.  I had not thought of that.  I will consider of her\r\npunishment.  Is thy father kind to thee?”\r\n\r\n“Not more than Gammer Canty, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Fathers be alike, mayhap.  Mine hath not a doll’s temper.  He smiteth\r\nwith a heavy hand, yet spareth me:  he spareth me not always with his\r\ntongue, though, sooth to say.  How doth thy mother use thee?”\r\n\r\n“She is good, sir, and giveth me neither sorrow nor pain of any sort.\r\nAnd Nan and Bet are like to her in this.”\r\n\r\n“How old be these?”\r\n\r\n“Fifteen, an’ it please you, sir.”\r\n\r\n“The Lady Elizabeth, my sister, is fourteen, and the Lady Jane Grey,\r\nmy cousin, is of mine own age, and comely and gracious withal; but\r\nmy sister the Lady Mary, with her gloomy mien and--Look you:  do thy\r\nsisters forbid their servants to smile, lest the sin destroy their\r\nsouls?”\r\n\r\n“They?  Oh, dost think, sir, that _they_ have servants?”\r\n\r\nThe little prince contemplated the little pauper gravely a moment, then\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n“And prithee, why not?  Who helpeth them undress at night?  Who attireth\r\nthem when they rise?”\r\n\r\n“None, sir.  Would’st have them take off their garment, and sleep\r\nwithout--like the beasts?”\r\n\r\n“Their garment!  Have they but one?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, good your worship, what would they do with more?  Truly they have\r\nnot two bodies each.”\r\n\r\n“It is a quaint and marvellous thought!  Thy pardon, I had not meant\r\nto laugh.  But thy good Nan and thy Bet shall have raiment and lackeys\r\nenow, and that soon, too:  my cofferer shall look to it.  No, thank me\r\nnot; ’tis nothing.  Thou speakest well; thou hast an easy grace in it.\r\n Art learned?”\r\n\r\n“I know not if I am or not, sir.  The good priest that is called Father\r\nAndrew taught me, of his kindness, from his books.”\r\n\r\n“Know’st thou the Latin?”\r\n\r\n“But scantly, sir, I doubt.”\r\n\r\n“Learn it, lad:  ’tis hard only at first.  The Greek is harder; but\r\nneither these nor any tongues else, I think, are hard to the Lady\r\nElizabeth and my cousin.  Thou should’st hear those damsels at it!  But\r\ntell me of thy Offal Court.  Hast thou a pleasant life there?”\r\n\r\n“In truth, yes, so please you, sir, save when one is hungry. There\r\nbe Punch-and-Judy shows, and monkeys--oh such antic creatures! and so\r\nbravely dressed!--and there be plays wherein they that play do shout\r\nand fight till all are slain, and ’tis so fine to see, and costeth but\r\na farthing--albeit ’tis main hard to get the farthing, please your\r\nworship.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me more.”\r\n\r\n“We lads of Offal Court do strive against each other with the cudgel,\r\nlike to the fashion of the ‘prentices, sometimes.”\r\n\r\nThe prince’s eyes flashed.  Said he--\r\n\r\n“Marry, that would not I mislike.  Tell me more.”\r\n\r\n“We strive in races, sir, to see who of us shall be fleetest.”\r\n\r\n“That would I like also.  Speak on.”\r\n\r\n“In summer, sir, we wade and swim in the canals and in the river, and\r\neach doth duck his neighbour, and splatter him with water, and dive and\r\nshout and tumble and--”\r\n\r\n“‘Twould be worth my father’s kingdom but to enjoy it once! Prithee go\r\non.”\r\n\r\n“We dance and sing about the Maypole in Cheapside; we play in the sand,\r\neach covering his neighbour up; and times we make mud pastry--oh\r\nthe lovely mud, it hath not its like for delightfulness in all the\r\nworld!--we do fairly wallow in the mud, sir, saving your worship’s\r\npresence.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, prithee, say no more, ’tis glorious!  If that I could but clothe me\r\nin raiment like to thine, and strip my feet, and revel in the mud once,\r\njust once, with none to rebuke me or forbid, meseemeth I could forego\r\nthe crown!”\r\n\r\n“And if that I could clothe me once, sweet sir, as thou art clad--just\r\nonce--”\r\n\r\n“Oho, would’st like it?  Then so shall it be.  Doff thy rags, and don\r\nthese splendours, lad!  It is a brief happiness, but will be not less\r\nkeen for that.  We will have it while we may, and change again before\r\nany come to molest.”\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the little Prince of Wales was garlanded with Tom’s\r\nfluttering odds and ends, and the little Prince of Pauperdom was tricked\r\nout in the gaudy plumage of royalty.  The two went and stood side by\r\nside before a great mirror, and lo, a miracle: there did not seem to\r\nhave been any change made!  They stared at each other, then at the\r\nglass, then at each other again.  At last the puzzled princeling said--\r\n\r\n“What dost thou make of this?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, good your worship, require me not to answer.  It is not meet that\r\none of my degree should utter the thing.”\r\n\r\n“Then will _I_ utter it.  Thou hast the same hair, the same eyes, the\r\nsame voice and manner, the same form and stature, the same face and\r\ncountenance that I bear.  Fared we forth naked, there is none could\r\nsay which was you, and which the Prince of Wales.  And, now that I\r\nam clothed as thou wert clothed, it seemeth I should be able the more\r\nnearly to feel as thou didst when the brute soldier--Hark ye, is not\r\nthis a bruise upon your hand?”\r\n\r\n“Yes; but it is a slight thing, and your worship knoweth that the poor\r\nman-at-arms--”\r\n\r\n“Peace!  It was a shameful thing and a cruel!” cried the little prince,\r\nstamping his bare foot.  “If the King--Stir not a step till I come\r\nagain! It is a command!”\r\n\r\nIn a moment he had snatched up and put away an article of national\r\nimportance that lay upon a table, and was out at the door and flying\r\nthrough the palace grounds in his bannered rags, with a hot face and\r\nglowing eyes.  As soon as he reached the great gate, he seized the bars,\r\nand tried to shake them, shouting--\r\n\r\n“Open!  Unbar the gates!”\r\n\r\nThe soldier that had maltreated Tom obeyed promptly; and as the prince\r\nburst through the portal, half-smothered with royal wrath, the soldier\r\nfetched him a sounding box on the ear that sent him whirling to the\r\nroadway, and said--\r\n\r\n“Take that, thou beggar’s spawn, for what thou got’st me from his\r\nHighness!”\r\n\r\nThe crowd roared with laughter.  The prince picked himself out of the\r\nmud, and made fiercely at the sentry, shouting--\r\n\r\n“I am the Prince of Wales, my person is sacred; and thou shalt hang for\r\nlaying thy hand upon me!”\r\n\r\nThe soldier brought his halberd to a present-arms and said mockingly--\r\n\r\n“I salute your gracious Highness.”  Then angrily--“Be off, thou crazy\r\nrubbish!”\r\n\r\nHere the jeering crowd closed round the poor little prince, and hustled\r\nhim far down the road, hooting him, and shouting--\r\n\r\n“Way for his Royal Highness!  Way for the Prince of Wales!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV. The Prince’s troubles begin.\r\n\r\nAfter hours of persistent pursuit and persecution, the little prince was\r\nat last deserted by the rabble and left to himself.  As long as he had\r\nbeen able to rage against the mob, and threaten it royally, and\r\nroyally utter commands that were good stuff to laugh at, he was very\r\nentertaining; but when weariness finally forced him to be silent, he was\r\nno longer of use to his tormentors, and they sought amusement elsewhere.\r\nHe looked about him, now, but could not recognise the locality.  He\r\nwas within the city of London--that was all he knew.  He moved on,\r\naimlessly, and in a little while the houses thinned, and the passers-by\r\nwere infrequent.  He bathed his bleeding feet in the brook which flowed\r\nthen where Farringdon Street now is; rested a few moments, then passed\r\non, and presently came upon a great space with only a few scattered\r\nhouses in it, and a prodigious church.  He recognised this church.\r\n Scaffoldings were about, everywhere, and swarms of workmen; for it was\r\nundergoing elaborate repairs.  The prince took heart at once--he felt\r\nthat his troubles were at an end, now.  He said to himself, “It is the\r\nancient Grey Friars’ Church, which the king my father hath taken from\r\nthe monks and given for a home for ever for poor and forsaken children,\r\nand new-named it Christ’s Church.  Right gladly will they serve the son\r\nof him who hath done so generously by them--and the more that that son\r\nis himself as poor and as forlorn as any that be sheltered here this\r\nday, or ever shall be.”\r\n\r\nHe was soon in the midst of a crowd of boys who were running, jumping,\r\nplaying at ball and leap-frog, and otherwise disporting themselves, and\r\nright noisily, too.  They were all dressed alike, and in the fashion\r\nwhich in that day prevailed among serving-men and ‘prentices{1}--that\r\nis to say, each had on the crown of his head a flat black cap about the\r\nsize of a saucer, which was not useful as a covering, it being of such\r\nscanty dimensions, neither was it ornamental; from beneath it the hair\r\nfell, unparted, to the middle of the forehead, and was cropped straight\r\naround; a clerical band at the neck; a blue gown that fitted closely\r\nand hung as low as the knees or lower; full sleeves; a broad red belt;\r\nbright yellow stockings, gartered above the knees; low shoes with large\r\nmetal buckles. It was a sufficiently ugly costume.\r\n\r\nThe boys stopped their play and flocked about the prince, who said with\r\nnative dignity--\r\n\r\n“Good lads, say to your master that Edward Prince of Wales desireth\r\nspeech with him.”\r\n\r\nA great shout went up at this, and one rude fellow said--\r\n\r\n“Marry, art thou his grace’s messenger, beggar?”\r\n\r\nThe prince’s face flushed with anger, and his ready hand flew to his\r\nhip, but there was nothing there.  There was a storm of laughter, and\r\none boy said--\r\n\r\n“Didst mark that?  He fancied he had a sword--belike he is the prince\r\nhimself.”\r\n\r\nThis sally brought more laughter.  Poor Edward drew himself up proudly\r\nand said--\r\n\r\n“I am the prince; and it ill beseemeth you that feed upon the king my\r\nfather’s bounty to use me so.”\r\n\r\nThis was vastly enjoyed, as the laughter testified.  The youth who had\r\nfirst spoken, shouted to his comrades--\r\n\r\n“Ho, swine, slaves, pensioners of his grace’s princely father, where be\r\nyour manners?  Down on your marrow bones, all of ye, and do reverence to\r\nhis kingly port and royal rags!”\r\n\r\nWith boisterous mirth they dropped upon their knees in a body and did\r\nmock homage to their prey.  The prince spurned the nearest boy with his\r\nfoot, and said fiercely--\r\n\r\n“Take thou that, till the morrow come and I build thee a gibbet!”\r\n\r\nAh, but this was not a joke--this was going beyond fun.  The laughter\r\nceased on the instant, and fury took its place.  A dozen shouted--\r\n\r\n“Hale him forth!  To the horse-pond, to the horse-pond!  Where be the\r\ndogs?  Ho, there, Lion! ho, Fangs!”\r\n\r\nThen followed such a thing as England had never seen before--the sacred\r\nperson of the heir to the throne rudely buffeted by plebeian hands, and\r\nset upon and torn by dogs.\r\n\r\nAs night drew to a close that day, the prince found himself far down in\r\nthe close-built portion of the city.  His body was bruised, his hands\r\nwere bleeding, and his rags were all besmirched with mud.  He wandered\r\non and on, and grew more and more bewildered, and so tired and faint\r\nhe could hardly drag one foot after the other.  He had ceased to ask\r\nquestions of anyone, since they brought him only insult instead of\r\ninformation.  He kept muttering to himself, “Offal Court--that is the\r\nname; if I can but find it before my strength is wholly spent and I\r\ndrop, then am I saved--for his people will take me to the palace and\r\nprove that I am none of theirs, but the true prince, and I shall have\r\nmine own again.”  And now and then his mind reverted to his treatment\r\nby those rude Christ’s Hospital boys, and he said, “When I am king, they\r\nshall not have bread and shelter only, but also teachings out of books;\r\nfor a full belly is little worth where the mind is starved, and the\r\nheart.  I will keep this diligently in my remembrance, that this day’s\r\nlesson be not lost upon me, and my people suffer thereby; for learning\r\nsofteneth the heart and breedeth gentleness and charity.” {1}\r\n\r\nThe lights began to twinkle, it came on to rain, the wind rose, and a\r\nraw and gusty night set in.  The houseless prince, the homeless heir to\r\nthe throne of England, still moved on, drifting deeper into the maze\r\nof squalid alleys where the swarming hives of poverty and misery were\r\nmassed together.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a great drunken ruffian collared him and said--\r\n\r\n“Out to this time of night again, and hast not brought a farthing home,\r\nI warrant me!  If it be so, an’ I do not break all the bones in thy lean\r\nbody, then am I not John Canty, but some other.”\r\n\r\nThe prince twisted himself loose, unconsciously brushed his profaned\r\nshoulder, and eagerly said--\r\n\r\n“Oh, art _his_ father, truly?  Sweet heaven grant it be so--then wilt\r\nthou fetch him away and restore me!”\r\n\r\n“_His_ father?  I know not what thou mean’st; I but know I am _thy_\r\nfather, as thou shalt soon have cause to--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, jest not, palter not, delay not!--I am worn, I am wounded, I can\r\nbear no more.  Take me to the king my father, and he will make thee rich\r\nbeyond thy wildest dreams.  Believe me, man, believe me!--I speak no\r\nlie, but only the truth!--put forth thy hand and save me!  I am indeed\r\nthe Prince of Wales!”\r\n\r\nThe man stared down, stupefied, upon the lad, then shook his head and\r\nmuttered--\r\n\r\n“Gone stark mad as any Tom o’ Bedlam!”--then collared him once more,\r\nand said with a coarse laugh and an oath, “But mad or no mad, I and thy\r\nGammer Canty will soon find where the soft places in thy bones lie, or\r\nI’m no true man!”\r\n\r\nWith this he dragged the frantic and struggling prince away, and\r\ndisappeared up a front court followed by a delighted and noisy swarm of\r\nhuman vermin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V. Tom as a Patrician.\r\n\r\nTom Canty, left alone in the prince’s cabinet, made good use of his\r\nopportunity.  He turned himself this way and that before the great\r\nmirror, admiring his finery; then walked away, imitating the prince’s\r\nhigh-bred carriage, and still observing results in the glass.  Next he\r\ndrew the beautiful sword, and bowed, kissing the blade, and laying it\r\nacross his breast, as he had seen a noble knight do, by way of salute to\r\nthe lieutenant of the Tower, five or six weeks before, when delivering\r\nthe great lords of Norfolk and Surrey into his hands for captivity.  Tom\r\nplayed with the jewelled dagger that hung upon his thigh; he examined\r\nthe costly and exquisite ornaments of the room; he tried each of the\r\nsumptuous chairs, and thought how proud he would be if the Offal Court\r\nherd could only peep in and see him in his grandeur.  He wondered if\r\nthey would believe the marvellous tale he should tell when he got home,\r\nor if they would shake their heads, and say his overtaxed imagination\r\nhad at last upset his reason.\r\n\r\nAt the end of half an hour it suddenly occurred to him that the prince\r\nwas gone a long time; then right away he began to feel lonely; very\r\nsoon he fell to listening and longing, and ceased to toy with the\r\npretty things about him; he grew uneasy, then restless, then distressed.\r\nSuppose some one should come, and catch him in the prince’s clothes, and\r\nthe prince not there to explain.  Might they not hang him at once,\r\nand inquire into his case afterward?  He had heard that the great\r\nwere prompt about small matters.  His fear rose higher and higher; and\r\ntrembling he softly opened the door to the antechamber, resolved to\r\nfly and seek the prince, and, through him, protection and release.  Six\r\ngorgeous gentlemen-servants and two young pages of high degree, clothed\r\nlike butterflies, sprang to their feet and bowed low before him.  He\r\nstepped quickly back and shut the door.  He said--\r\n\r\n“Oh, they mock at me!  They will go and tell.  Oh! why came I here to\r\ncast away my life?”\r\n\r\nHe walked up and down the floor, filled with nameless fears, listening,\r\nstarting at every trifling sound.  Presently the door swung open, and a\r\nsilken page said--\r\n\r\n“The Lady Jane Grey.”\r\n\r\nThe door closed and a sweet young girl, richly clad, bounded toward him.\r\nBut she stopped suddenly, and said in a distressed voice--\r\n\r\n“Oh, what aileth thee, my lord?”\r\n\r\nTom’s breath was nearly failing him; but he made shift to stammer out--\r\n\r\n“Ah, be merciful, thou!  In sooth I am no lord, but only poor Tom Canty\r\nof Offal Court in the city.  Prithee let me see the prince, and he will\r\nof his grace restore to me my rags, and let me hence unhurt.  Oh, be\r\nthou merciful, and save me!”\r\n\r\nBy this time the boy was on his knees, and supplicating with his eyes\r\nand uplifted hands as well as with his tongue.  The young girl seemed\r\nhorror-stricken.  She cried out--\r\n\r\n“O my lord, on thy knees?--and to _me_!”\r\n\r\nThen she fled away in fright; and Tom, smitten with despair, sank down,\r\nmurmuring--\r\n\r\n“There is no help, there is no hope.  Now will they come and take me.”\r\n\r\nWhilst he lay there benumbed with terror, dreadful tidings were speeding\r\nthrough the palace.  The whisper--for it was whispered always--flew from\r\nmenial to menial, from lord to lady, down all the long corridors, from\r\nstory to story, from saloon to saloon, “The prince hath gone mad, the\r\nprince hath gone mad!”  Soon every saloon, every marble hall, had its\r\ngroups of glittering lords and ladies, and other groups of dazzling\r\nlesser folk, talking earnestly together in whispers, and every face\r\nhad in it dismay. Presently a splendid official came marching by these\r\ngroups, making solemn proclamation--\r\n\r\n“IN THE NAME OF THE KING!\r\n\r\nLet none list to this false and foolish matter, upon pain of death, nor\r\ndiscuss the same, nor carry it abroad.  In the name of the King!”\r\n\r\nThe whisperings ceased as suddenly as if the whisperers had been\r\nstricken dumb.\r\n\r\nSoon there was a general buzz along the corridors, of “The prince! See,\r\nthe prince comes!”\r\n\r\nPoor Tom came slowly walking past the low-bowing groups, trying to\r\nbow in return, and meekly gazing upon his strange surroundings with\r\nbewildered and pathetic eyes.  Great nobles walked upon each side of\r\nhim, making him lean upon them, and so steady his steps. Behind him\r\nfollowed the court-physicians and some servants.\r\n\r\nPresently Tom found himself in a noble apartment of the palace and heard\r\nthe door close behind him.  Around him stood those who had come with\r\nhim. Before him, at a little distance, reclined a very large and very\r\nfat man, with a wide, pulpy face, and a stern expression.  His large\r\nhead was very grey; and his whiskers, which he wore only around his\r\nface, like a frame, were grey also.  His clothing was of rich stuff,\r\nbut old, and slightly frayed in places.  One of his swollen legs had a\r\npillow under it, and was wrapped in bandages.  There was silence now;\r\nand there was no head there but was bent in reverence, except this\r\nman’s.  This stern-countenanced invalid was the dread Henry VIII.  He\r\nsaid--and his face grew gentle as he began to speak--\r\n\r\n“How now, my lord Edward, my prince?  Hast been minded to cozen me, the\r\ngood King thy father, who loveth thee, and kindly useth thee, with a\r\nsorry jest?”\r\n\r\nPoor Tom was listening, as well as his dazed faculties would let him,\r\nto the beginning of this speech; but when the words ‘me, the good King’\r\nfell upon his ear, his face blanched, and he dropped as instantly upon\r\nhis knees as if a shot had brought him there. Lifting up his hands, he\r\nexclaimed--\r\n\r\n“Thou the _King_?  Then am I undone indeed!”\r\n\r\nThis speech seemed to stun the King.  His eyes wandered from face to\r\nface aimlessly, then rested, bewildered, upon the boy before him.  Then\r\nhe said in a tone of deep disappointment--\r\n\r\n“Alack, I had believed the rumour disproportioned to the truth; but I\r\nfear me ’tis not so.”  He breathed a heavy sigh, and said in a gentle\r\nvoice, “Come to thy father, child:  thou art not well.”\r\n\r\nTom was assisted to his feet, and approached the Majesty of England,\r\nhumble and trembling.  The King took the frightened face between his\r\nhands, and gazed earnestly and lovingly into it awhile, as if seeking\r\nsome grateful sign of returning reason there, then pressed the curly\r\nhead against his breast, and patted it tenderly.  Presently he said--\r\n\r\n“Dost not know thy father, child?  Break not mine old heart; say thou\r\nknow’st me.  Thou _dost_ know me, dost thou not?”\r\n\r\n“Yea:  thou art my dread lord the King, whom God preserve!”\r\n\r\n“True, true--that is well--be comforted, tremble not so; there is none\r\nhere would hurt thee; there is none here but loves thee. Thou art better\r\nnow; thy ill dream passeth--is’t not so?  Thou wilt not miscall thyself\r\nagain, as they say thou didst a little while agone?”\r\n\r\n“I pray thee of thy grace believe me, I did but speak the truth, most\r\ndread lord; for I am the meanest among thy subjects, being a pauper\r\nborn, and ’tis by a sore mischance and accident I am here, albeit I was\r\ntherein nothing blameful.  I am but young to die, and thou canst save me\r\nwith one little word.  Oh speak it, sir!”\r\n\r\n“Die?  Talk not so, sweet prince--peace, peace, to thy troubled\r\nheart--thou shalt not die!”\r\n\r\nTom dropped upon his knees with a glad cry--\r\n\r\n“God requite thy mercy, O my King, and save thee long to bless thy\r\nland!” Then springing up, he turned a joyful face toward the two lords\r\nin waiting, and exclaimed, “Thou heard’st it!  I am not to die:  the\r\nKing hath said it!”  There was no movement, save that all bowed with\r\ngrave respect; but no one spoke.  He hesitated, a little confused, then\r\nturned timidly toward the King, saying, “I may go now?”\r\n\r\n“Go?  Surely, if thou desirest.  But why not tarry yet a little? Whither\r\nwould’st go?”\r\n\r\nTom dropped his eyes, and answered humbly--\r\n\r\n“Peradventure I mistook; but I did think me free, and so was I moved\r\nto seek again the kennel where I was born and bred to misery, yet which\r\nharboureth my mother and my sisters, and so is home to me; whereas these\r\npomps and splendours whereunto I am not used--oh, please you, sir, to\r\nlet me go!”\r\n\r\nThe King was silent and thoughtful a while, and his face betrayed a\r\ngrowing distress and uneasiness.  Presently he said, with something of\r\nhope in his voice--\r\n\r\n“Perchance he is but mad upon this one strain, and hath his wits\r\nunmarred as toucheth other matter.  God send it may be so!  We will make\r\ntrial.”\r\n\r\nThen he asked Tom a question in Latin, and Tom answered him lamely in\r\nthe same tongue.  The lords and doctors manifested their gratification\r\nalso. The King said--\r\n\r\n“‘Twas not according to his schooling and ability, but showeth that his\r\nmind is but diseased, not stricken fatally.  How say you, sir?”\r\n\r\nThe physician addressed bowed low, and replied--\r\n\r\n“It jumpeth with my own conviction, sire, that thou hast divined\r\naright.”\r\n\r\nThe King looked pleased with this encouragement, coming as it did from\r\nso excellent authority, and continued with good heart--\r\n\r\n“Now mark ye all:  we will try him further.”\r\n\r\nHe put a question to Tom in French.  Tom stood silent a moment,\r\nembarrassed by having so many eyes centred upon him, then said\r\ndiffidently--\r\n\r\n“I have no knowledge of this tongue, so please your majesty.”\r\n\r\nThe King fell back upon his couch.  The attendants flew to his\r\nassistance; but he put them aside, and said--\r\n\r\n“Trouble me not--it is nothing but a scurvy faintness.  Raise me! There,\r\n‘tis sufficient.  Come hither, child; there, rest thy poor troubled head\r\nupon thy father’s heart, and be at peace.  Thou’lt soon be well:  ’tis\r\nbut a passing fantasy.  Fear thou not; thou’lt soon be well.”  Then\r\nhe turned toward the company:  his gentle manner changed, and baleful\r\nlightnings began to play from his eyes.  He said--\r\n\r\n“List ye all!  This my son is mad; but it is not permanent.  Over-study\r\nhath done this, and somewhat too much of confinement.  Away with his\r\nbooks and teachers! see ye to it.  Pleasure him with sports, beguile him\r\nin wholesome ways, so that his health come again.”  He raised himself\r\nhigher still, and went on with energy, “He is mad; but he is my son,\r\nand England’s heir; and, mad or sane, still shall he reign!  And hear ye\r\nfurther, and proclaim it: whoso speaketh of this his distemper worketh\r\nagainst the peace and order of these realms, and shall to the gallows!\r\n. . . Give me to drink--I burn:  this sorrow sappeth my strength. . . .\r\nThere, take away the cup. . . . Support me.  There, that is well.  Mad,\r\nis he?  Were he a thousand times mad, yet is he Prince of Wales, and I\r\nthe King will confirm it.  This very morrow shall he be installed in his\r\nprincely dignity in due and ancient form.  Take instant order for it, my\r\nlord Hertford.”\r\n\r\nOne of the nobles knelt at the royal couch, and said--\r\n\r\n“The King’s majesty knoweth that the Hereditary Great Marshal of England\r\nlieth attainted in the Tower.  It were not meet that one attainted--”\r\n\r\n“Peace!  Insult not mine ears with his hated name.  Is this man to\r\nlive for ever?  Am I to be baulked of my will?  Is the prince to tarry\r\nuninstalled, because, forsooth, the realm lacketh an Earl Marshal\r\nfree of treasonable taint to invest him with his honours? No, by the\r\nsplendour of God!  Warn my Parliament to bring me Norfolk’s doom before\r\nthe sun rise again, else shall they answer for it grievously!” {1}\r\n\r\nLord Hertford said--\r\n\r\n“The King’s will is law;” and, rising, returned to his former place.\r\n\r\nGradually the wrath faded out of the old King’s face, and he said--\r\n\r\n“Kiss me, my prince.  There . . . what fearest thou?  Am I not thy\r\nloving father?”\r\n\r\n“Thou art good to me that am unworthy, O mighty and gracious lord: that\r\nin truth I know.  But--but--it grieveth me to think of him that is to\r\ndie, and--”\r\n\r\n“Ah, ’tis like thee, ’tis like thee!  I know thy heart is still the\r\nsame, even though thy mind hath suffered hurt, for thou wert ever of a\r\ngentle spirit.  But this duke standeth between thee and thine honours:\r\n I will have another in his stead that shall bring no taint to his great\r\noffice. Comfort thee, my prince:  trouble not thy poor head with this\r\nmatter.”\r\n\r\n“But is it not I that speed him hence, my liege?  How long might he not\r\nlive, but for me?”\r\n\r\n“Take no thought of him, my prince:  he is not worthy.  Kiss me once\r\nagain, and go to thy trifles and amusements; for my malady distresseth\r\nme.  I am aweary, and would rest.  Go with thine uncle Hertford and thy\r\npeople, and come again when my body is refreshed.”\r\n\r\nTom, heavy-hearted, was conducted from the presence, for this last\r\nsentence was a death-blow to the hope he had cherished that now he would\r\nbe set free.  Once more he heard the buzz of low voices exclaiming, “The\r\nprince, the prince comes!”\r\n\r\nHis spirits sank lower and lower as he moved between the glittering\r\nfiles of bowing courtiers; for he recognised that he was indeed a\r\ncaptive now, and might remain for ever shut up in this gilded cage, a\r\nforlorn and friendless prince, except God in his mercy take pity on him\r\nand set him free.\r\n\r\nAnd, turn where he would, he seemed to see floating in the air the\r\nsevered head and the remembered face of the great Duke of Norfolk, the\r\neyes fixed on him reproachfully.\r\n\r\nHis old dreams had been so pleasant; but this reality was so dreary!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI. Tom receives instructions.\r\n\r\nTom was conducted to the principal apartment of a noble suite, and made\r\nto sit down--a thing which he was loth to do, since there were elderly\r\nmen and men of high degree about him.  He begged them to be seated\r\nalso, but they only bowed their thanks or murmured them, and remained\r\nstanding. He would have insisted, but his ‘uncle’ the Earl of Hertford\r\nwhispered in his ear--\r\n\r\n“Prithee, insist not, my lord; it is not meet that they sit in thy\r\npresence.”\r\n\r\nThe Lord St. John was announced, and after making obeisance to Tom, he\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n“I come upon the King’s errand, concerning a matter which requireth\r\nprivacy.  Will it please your royal highness to dismiss all that attend\r\nyou here, save my lord the Earl of Hertford?”\r\n\r\nObserving that Tom did not seem to know how to proceed, Hertford\r\nwhispered him to make a sign with his hand, and not trouble himself to\r\nspeak unless he chose.  When the waiting gentlemen had retired, Lord St.\r\nJohn said--\r\n\r\n“His majesty commandeth, that for due and weighty reasons of state, the\r\nprince’s grace shall hide his infirmity in all ways that be within his\r\npower, till it be passed and he be as he was before.  To wit, that he\r\nshall deny to none that he is the true prince, and heir to England’s\r\ngreatness; that he shall uphold his princely dignity, and shall receive,\r\nwithout word or sign of protest, that reverence and observance which\r\nunto it do appertain of right and ancient usage; that he shall cease to\r\nspeak to any of that lowly birth and life his malady hath conjured\r\nout of the unwholesome imaginings of o’er-wrought fancy; that he shall\r\nstrive with diligence to bring unto his memory again those faces which\r\nhe was wont to know--and where he faileth he shall hold his peace,\r\nneither betraying by semblance of surprise or other sign that he hath\r\nforgot; that upon occasions of state, whensoever any matter shall\r\nperplex him as to the thing he should do or the utterance he should\r\nmake, he shall show nought of unrest to the curious that look on, but\r\ntake advice in that matter of the Lord Hertford, or my humble self,\r\nwhich are commanded of the King to be upon this service and close at\r\ncall, till this commandment be dissolved. Thus saith the King’s majesty,\r\nwho sendeth greeting to your royal highness, and prayeth that God will\r\nof His mercy quickly heal you and have you now and ever in His holy\r\nkeeping.”\r\n\r\nThe Lord St. John made reverence and stood aside.  Tom replied\r\nresignedly--\r\n\r\n“The King hath said it.  None may palter with the King’s command, or fit\r\nit to his ease, where it doth chafe, with deft evasions. The King shall\r\nbe obeyed.”\r\n\r\nLord Hertford said--\r\n\r\n“Touching the King’s majesty’s ordainment concerning books and such like\r\nserious matters, it may peradventure please your highness to ease your\r\ntime with lightsome entertainment, lest you go wearied to the banquet\r\nand suffer harm thereby.”\r\n\r\nTom’s face showed inquiring surprise; and a blush followed when he saw\r\nLord St. John’s eyes bent sorrowfully upon him.  His lordship said--\r\n\r\n“Thy memory still wrongeth thee, and thou hast shown surprise--but\r\nsuffer it not to trouble thee, for ’tis a matter that will not bide,\r\nbut depart with thy mending malady.  My Lord of Hertford speaketh of\r\nthe city’s banquet which the King’s majesty did promise, some two months\r\nflown, your highness should attend.  Thou recallest it now?”\r\n\r\n“It grieves me to confess it had indeed escaped me,” said Tom, in a\r\nhesitating voice; and blushed again.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the Lady Elizabeth and the Lady Jane Grey were announced.\r\nThe two lords exchanged significant glances, and Hertford stepped\r\nquickly toward the door.  As the young girls passed him, he said in a\r\nlow voice--\r\n\r\n“I pray ye, ladies, seem not to observe his humours, nor show surprise\r\nwhen his memory doth lapse--it will grieve you to note how it doth stick\r\nat every trifle.”\r\n\r\nMeantime Lord St. John was saying in Tom’s ear--\r\n\r\n“Please you, sir, keep diligently in mind his majesty’s desire. Remember\r\nall thou canst--_seem_ to remember all else.  Let them not perceive that\r\nthou art much changed from thy wont, for thou knowest how tenderly thy\r\nold play-fellows bear thee in their hearts and how ’twould grieve them.\r\nArt willing, sir, that I remain?--and thine uncle?”\r\n\r\nTom signified assent with a gesture and a murmured word, for he was\r\nalready learning, and in his simple heart was resolved to acquit himself\r\nas best he might, according to the King’s command.\r\n\r\nIn spite of every precaution, the conversation among the young people\r\nbecame a little embarrassing at times.  More than once, in truth,\r\nTom was near to breaking down and confessing himself unequal to his\r\ntremendous part; but the tact of the Princess Elizabeth saved him, or a\r\nword from one or the other of the vigilant lords, thrown in apparently\r\nby chance, had the same happy effect.  Once the little Lady Jane turned\r\nto Tom and dismayed him with this question,--\r\n\r\n“Hast paid thy duty to the Queen’s majesty to-day, my lord?”\r\n\r\nTom hesitated, looked distressed, and was about to stammer out something\r\nat hazard, when Lord St. John took the word and answered for him\r\nwith the easy grace of a courtier accustomed to encounter delicate\r\ndifficulties and to be ready for them--\r\n\r\n“He hath indeed, madam, and she did greatly hearten him, as touching his\r\nmajesty’s condition; is it not so, your highness?”\r\n\r\nTom mumbled something that stood for assent, but felt that he was\r\ngetting upon dangerous ground.  Somewhat later it was mentioned that\r\nTom was to study no more at present, whereupon her little ladyship\r\nexclaimed--\r\n\r\n“‘Tis a pity, ’tis a pity!  Thou wert proceeding bravely.  But bide thy\r\ntime in patience:  it will not be for long.  Thou’lt yet be graced\r\nwith learning like thy father, and make thy tongue master of as many\r\nlanguages as his, good my prince.”\r\n\r\n“My father!” cried Tom, off his guard for the moment.  “I trow he cannot\r\nspeak his own so that any but the swine that kennel in the styes may\r\ntell his meaning; and as for learning of any sort soever--”\r\n\r\nHe looked up and encountered a solemn warning in my Lord St. John’s\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nHe stopped, blushed, then continued low and sadly: “Ah, my malady\r\npersecuteth me again, and my mind wandereth.  I meant the King’s grace\r\nno irreverence.”\r\n\r\n“We know it, sir,” said the Princess Elizabeth, taking her ‘brother’s’\r\nhand between her two palms, respectfully but caressingly; “trouble not\r\nthyself as to that.  The fault is none of thine, but thy distemper’s.”\r\n\r\n“Thou’rt a gentle comforter, sweet lady,” said Tom, gratefully, “and my\r\nheart moveth me to thank thee for’t, an’ I may be so bold.”\r\n\r\nOnce the giddy little Lady Jane fired a simple Greek phrase at Tom.\r\n The Princess Elizabeth’s quick eye saw by the serene blankness of the\r\ntarget’s front that the shaft was overshot; so she tranquilly delivered\r\na return volley of sounding Greek on Tom’s behalf, and then straightway\r\nchanged the talk to other matters.\r\n\r\nTime wore on pleasantly, and likewise smoothly, on the whole. Snags and\r\nsandbars grew less and less frequent, and Tom grew more and more at\r\nhis ease, seeing that all were so lovingly bent upon helping him and\r\noverlooking his mistakes.  When it came out that the little ladies were\r\nto accompany him to the Lord Mayor’s banquet in the evening, his heart\r\ngave a bound of relief and delight, for he felt that he should not be\r\nfriendless, now, among that multitude of strangers; whereas, an\r\nhour earlier, the idea of their going with him would have been an\r\ninsupportable terror to him.\r\n\r\nTom’s guardian angels, the two lords, had had less comfort in the\r\ninterview than the other parties to it.  They felt much as if they were\r\npiloting a great ship through a dangerous channel; they were on the\r\nalert constantly, and found their office no child’s play. Wherefore,\r\nat last, when the ladies’ visit was drawing to a close and the Lord\r\nGuilford Dudley was announced, they not only felt that their charge had\r\nbeen sufficiently taxed for the present, but also that they themselves\r\nwere not in the best condition to take their ship back and make their\r\nanxious voyage all over again.  So they respectfully advised Tom to\r\nexcuse himself, which he was very glad to do, although a slight shade\r\nof disappointment might have been observed upon my Lady Jane’s face when\r\nshe heard the splendid stripling denied admittance.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause now, a sort of waiting silence which Tom could not\r\nunderstand.  He glanced at Lord Hertford, who gave him a sign--but he\r\nfailed to understand that also.  The ready Elizabeth came to the rescue\r\nwith her usual easy grace.  She made reverence and said--\r\n\r\n“Have we leave of the prince’s grace my brother to go?”\r\n\r\nTom said--\r\n\r\n“Indeed your ladyships can have whatsoever of me they will, for the\r\nasking; yet would I rather give them any other thing that in my poor\r\npower lieth, than leave to take the light and blessing of their presence\r\nhence.  Give ye good den, and God be with ye!” Then he smiled inwardly\r\nat the thought, “‘Tis not for nought I have dwelt but among princes in\r\nmy reading, and taught my tongue some slight trick of their broidered\r\nand gracious speech withal!”\r\n\r\nWhen the illustrious maidens were gone, Tom turned wearily to his\r\nkeepers and said--\r\n\r\n“May it please your lordships to grant me leave to go into some corner\r\nand rest me?”\r\n\r\nLord Hertford said--\r\n\r\n“So please your highness, it is for you to command, it is for us to\r\nobey. That thou should’st rest is indeed a needful thing, since thou\r\nmust journey to the city presently.”\r\n\r\nHe touched a bell, and a page appeared, who was ordered to desire the\r\npresence of Sir William Herbert.  This gentleman came straightway, and\r\nconducted Tom to an inner apartment.  Tom’s first movement there was\r\nto reach for a cup of water; but a silk-and-velvet servitor seized it,\r\ndropped upon one knee, and offered it to him on a golden salver.\r\n\r\nNext the tired captive sat down and was going to take off his buskins,\r\ntimidly asking leave with his eye, but another silk-and-velvet\r\ndiscomforter went down upon his knees and took the office from him.  He\r\nmade two or three further efforts to help himself, but being promptly\r\nforestalled each time, he finally gave up, with a sigh of resignation\r\nand a murmured “Beshrew me, but I marvel they do not require to breathe\r\nfor me also!”  Slippered, and wrapped in a sumptuous robe, he laid\r\nhimself down at last to rest, but not to sleep, for his head was too\r\nfull of thoughts and the room too full of people.  He could not dismiss\r\nthe former, so they stayed; he did not know enough to dismiss the\r\nlatter, so they stayed also, to his vast regret--and theirs.\r\n\r\nTom’s departure had left his two noble guardians alone.  They mused a\r\nwhile, with much head-shaking and walking the floor, then Lord St. John\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n“Plainly, what dost thou think?”\r\n\r\n“Plainly, then, this.  The King is near his end; my nephew is mad--mad\r\nwill mount the throne, and mad remain.  God protect England, since she\r\nwill need it!”\r\n\r\n“Verily it promiseth so, indeed.  But . . . have you no misgivings as to\r\n. . . as to . . .”\r\n\r\nThe speaker hesitated, and finally stopped.  He evidently felt that he\r\nwas upon delicate ground.  Lord Hertford stopped before him, looked into\r\nhis face with a clear, frank eye, and said--\r\n\r\n“Speak on--there is none to hear but me.  Misgivings as to what?”\r\n\r\n“I am full loth to word the thing that is in my mind, and thou so near\r\nto him in blood, my lord.  But craving pardon if I do offend, seemeth it\r\nnot strange that madness could so change his port and manner?--not but\r\nthat his port and speech are princely still, but that they _differ_,\r\nin one unweighty trifle or another, from what his custom was aforetime.\r\n Seemeth it not strange that madness should filch from his memory his\r\nfather’s very lineaments; the customs and observances that are his due\r\nfrom such as be about him; and, leaving him his Latin, strip him of his\r\nGreek and French?  My lord, be not offended, but ease my mind of its\r\ndisquiet and receive my grateful thanks.  It haunteth me, his saying he\r\nwas not the prince, and so--”\r\n\r\n“Peace, my lord, thou utterest treason!  Hast forgot the King’s command?\r\nRemember I am party to thy crime if I but listen.”\r\n\r\nSt. John paled, and hastened to say--\r\n\r\n“I was in fault, I do confess it.  Betray me not, grant me this grace\r\nout of thy courtesy, and I will neither think nor speak of this thing\r\nmore. Deal not hardly with me, sir, else am I ruined.”\r\n\r\n“I am content, my lord.  So thou offend not again, here or in the\r\nears of others, it shall be as though thou hadst not spoken.  But thou\r\nneed’st not have misgivings.  He is my sister’s son; are not his voice,\r\nhis face, his form, familiar to me from his cradle? Madness can do all\r\nthe odd conflicting things thou seest in him, and more.  Dost not recall\r\nhow that the old Baron Marley, being mad, forgot the favour of his\r\nown countenance that he had known for sixty years, and held it was\r\nanother’s; nay, even claimed he was the son of Mary Magdalene, and that\r\nhis head was made of Spanish glass; and, sooth to say, he suffered none\r\nto touch it, lest by mischance some heedless hand might shiver it?  Give\r\nthy misgivings easement, good my lord.  This is the very prince--I know\r\nhim well--and soon will be thy king; it may advantage thee to bear this\r\nin mind, and more dwell upon it than the other.”\r\n\r\nAfter some further talk, in which the Lord St. John covered up his\r\nmistake as well as he could by repeated protests that his faith was\r\nthoroughly grounded now, and could not be assailed by doubts again, the\r\nLord Hertford relieved his fellow-keeper, and sat down to keep watch and\r\nward alone.  He was soon deep in meditation, and evidently the longer he\r\nthought, the more he was bothered.  By-and-by he began to pace the floor\r\nand mutter.\r\n\r\n“Tush, he _must_ be the prince!  Will any be in all the land maintain\r\nthere can be two, not of one blood and birth, so marvellously twinned?\r\n And even were it so, ’twere yet a stranger miracle that chance should\r\ncast the one into the other’s place. Nay, ’tis folly, folly, folly!”\r\n\r\nPresently he said--\r\n\r\n“Now were he impostor and called himself prince, look you _that_ would\r\nbe natural; that would be reasonable.  But lived ever an impostor yet,\r\nwho, being called prince by the king, prince by the court, prince by\r\nall, _denied_ his dignity and pleaded against his exaltation?  _No_!  By\r\nthe soul of St. Swithin, no!  This is the true prince, gone mad!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII. Tom’s first royal dinner.\r\n\r\nSomewhat after one in the afternoon, Tom resignedly underwent the ordeal\r\nof being dressed for dinner.  He found himself as finely clothed as\r\nbefore, but everything different, everything changed, from his ruff to\r\nhis stockings.  He was presently conducted with much state to a spacious\r\nand ornate apartment, where a table was already set for one.  Its\r\nfurniture was all of massy gold, and beautified with designs which\r\nwell-nigh made it priceless, since they were the work of Benvenuto.  The\r\nroom was half-filled with noble servitors.  A chaplain said grace, and\r\nTom was about to fall to, for hunger had long been constitutional with\r\nhim, but was interrupted by my lord the Earl of Berkeley, who fastened a\r\nnapkin about his neck; for the great post of Diaperers to the Prince\r\nof Wales was hereditary in this nobleman’s family.  Tom’s cupbearer was\r\npresent, and forestalled all his attempts to help himself to wine.  The\r\nTaster to his highness the Prince of Wales was there also, prepared to\r\ntaste any suspicious dish upon requirement, and run the risk of being\r\npoisoned.  He was only an ornamental appendage at this time, and was\r\nseldom called upon to exercise his function; but there had been times,\r\nnot many generations past, when the office of taster had its perils,\r\nand was not a grandeur to be desired.  Why they did not use a dog or a\r\nplumber seems strange; but all the ways of royalty are strange.  My\r\nLord d’Arcy, First Groom of the Chamber, was there, to do goodness knows\r\nwhat; but there he was--let that suffice.  The Lord Chief Butler was\r\nthere, and stood behind Tom’s chair, overseeing the solemnities, under\r\ncommand of the Lord Great Steward and the Lord Head Cook, who stood\r\nnear.  Tom had three hundred and eighty-four servants beside these;\r\nbut they were not all in that room, of course, nor the quarter of them;\r\nneither was Tom aware yet that they existed.\r\n\r\nAll those that were present had been well drilled within the hour to\r\nremember that the prince was temporarily out of his head, and to be\r\ncareful to show no surprise at his vagaries.  These ‘vagaries’ were\r\nsoon on exhibition before them; but they only moved their compassion and\r\ntheir sorrow, not their mirth.  It was a heavy affliction to them to see\r\nthe beloved prince so stricken.\r\n\r\nPoor Tom ate with his fingers mainly; but no one smiled at it, or even\r\nseemed to observe it.  He inspected his napkin curiously, and with deep\r\ninterest, for it was of a very dainty and beautiful fabric, then said\r\nwith simplicity--\r\n\r\n“Prithee, take it away, lest in mine unheedfulness it be soiled.”\r\n\r\nThe Hereditary Diaperer took it away with reverent manner, and without\r\nword or protest of any sort.\r\n\r\nTom examined the turnips and the lettuce with interest, and asked what\r\nthey were, and if they were to be eaten; for it was only recently that\r\nmen had begun to raise these things in England in place of importing\r\nthem as luxuries from Holland. {1}  His question was answered with grave\r\nrespect, and no surprise manifested.  When he had finished his dessert,\r\nhe filled his pockets with nuts; but nobody appeared to be aware of it,\r\nor disturbed by it.  But the next moment he was himself disturbed by\r\nit, and showed discomposure; for this was the only service he had been\r\npermitted to do with his own hands during the meal, and he did not doubt\r\nthat he had done a most improper and unprincely thing.  At that moment\r\nthe muscles of his nose began to twitch, and the end of that organ to\r\nlift and wrinkle.  This continued, and Tom began to evince a growing\r\ndistress.  He looked appealingly, first at one and then another of the\r\nlords about him, and tears came into his eyes.  They sprang forward with\r\ndismay in their faces, and begged to know his trouble.  Tom said with\r\ngenuine anguish--\r\n\r\n“I crave your indulgence:  my nose itcheth cruelly.  What is the custom\r\nand usage in this emergence?  Prithee, speed, for ’tis but a little time\r\nthat I can bear it.”\r\n\r\nNone smiled; but all were sore perplexed, and looked one to the other\r\nin deep tribulation for counsel.  But behold, here was a dead wall, and\r\nnothing in English history to tell how to get over it.  The Master of\r\nCeremonies was not present:  there was no one who felt safe to venture\r\nupon this uncharted sea, or risk the attempt to solve this solemn\r\nproblem.  Alas! there was no Hereditary Scratcher.  Meantime the tears\r\nhad overflowed their banks, and begun to trickle down Tom’s cheeks.  His\r\ntwitching nose was pleading more urgently than ever for relief.  At last\r\nnature broke down the barriers of etiquette:  Tom lifted up an inward\r\nprayer for pardon if he was doing wrong, and brought relief to the\r\nburdened hearts of his court by scratching his nose himself.\r\n\r\nHis meal being ended, a lord came and held before him a broad, shallow,\r\ngolden dish with fragrant rosewater in it, to cleanse his mouth and\r\nfingers with; and my lord the Hereditary Diaperer stood by with a napkin\r\nfor his use.  Tom gazed at the dish a puzzled moment or two, then raised\r\nit to his lips, and gravely took a draught.  Then he returned it to the\r\nwaiting lord, and said--\r\n\r\n“Nay, it likes me not, my lord:  it hath a pretty flavour, but it\r\nwanteth strength.”\r\n\r\nThis new eccentricity of the prince’s ruined mind made all the hearts\r\nabout him ache; but the sad sight moved none to merriment.\r\n\r\nTom’s next unconscious blunder was to get up and leave the table\r\njust when the chaplain had taken his stand behind his chair, and with\r\nuplifted hands, and closed, uplifted eyes, was in the act of beginning\r\nthe blessing.  Still nobody seemed to perceive that the prince had done\r\na thing unusual.\r\n\r\nBy his own request our small friend was now conducted to his private\r\ncabinet, and left there alone to his own devices.  Hanging upon hooks in\r\nthe oaken wainscoting were the several pieces of a suit of shining steel\r\narmour, covered all over with beautiful designs exquisitely inlaid\r\nin gold.  This martial panoply belonged to the true prince--a recent\r\npresent from Madam Parr the Queen. Tom put on the greaves, the\r\ngauntlets, the plumed helmet, and such other pieces as he could don\r\nwithout assistance, and for a while was minded to call for help and\r\ncomplete the matter, but bethought him of the nuts he had brought away\r\nfrom dinner, and the joy it would be to eat them with no crowd to eye\r\nhim, and no Grand Hereditaries to pester him with undesired services;\r\nso he restored the pretty things to their several places, and soon was\r\ncracking nuts, and feeling almost naturally happy for the first time\r\nsince God for his sins had made him a prince.  When the nuts were all\r\ngone, he stumbled upon some inviting books in a closet, among them one\r\nabout the etiquette of the English court.  This was a prize. He lay down\r\nupon a sumptuous divan, and proceeded to instruct himself with honest\r\nzeal.  Let us leave him there for the present.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII. The Question of the Seal.\r\n\r\nAbout five o’clock Henry VIII. awoke out of an unrefreshing nap, and\r\nmuttered to himself, “Troublous dreams, troublous dreams! Mine end is\r\nnow at hand:  so say these warnings, and my failing pulses do confirm\r\nit.” Presently a wicked light flamed up in his eye, and he muttered,\r\n“Yet will not I die till _He_ go before.”\r\n\r\nHis attendants perceiving that he was awake, one of them asked his\r\npleasure concerning the Lord Chancellor, who was waiting without.\r\n\r\n“Admit him, admit him!” exclaimed the King eagerly.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chancellor entered, and knelt by the King’s couch, saying--\r\n\r\n“I have given order, and, according to the King’s command, the peers of\r\nthe realm, in their robes, do now stand at the bar of the House, where,\r\nhaving confirmed the Duke of Norfolk’s doom, they humbly wait his\r\nmajesty’s further pleasure in the matter.”\r\n\r\nThe King’s face lit up with a fierce joy.  Said he--\r\n\r\n“Lift me up!  In mine own person will I go before my Parliament, and\r\nwith mine own hand will I seal the warrant that rids me of--”\r\n\r\nHis voice failed; an ashen pallor swept the flush from his cheeks; and\r\nthe attendants eased him back upon his pillows, and hurriedly assisted\r\nhim with restoratives.  Presently he said sorrowfully--\r\n\r\n“Alack, how have I longed for this sweet hour! and lo, too late it\r\ncometh, and I am robbed of this so coveted chance.  But speed ye, speed\r\nye! let others do this happy office sith ’tis denied to me. I put my\r\nGreat Seal in commission:  choose thou the lords that shall compose it,\r\nand get ye to your work.  Speed ye, man!  Before the sun shall rise and\r\nset again, bring me his head that I may see it.”\r\n\r\n“According to the King’s command, so shall it be.  Will’t please your\r\nmajesty to order that the Seal be now restored to me, so that I may\r\nforth upon the business?”\r\n\r\n“The Seal?  Who keepeth the Seal but thou?”\r\n\r\n“Please your majesty, you did take it from me two days since, saying it\r\nshould no more do its office till your own royal hand should use it upon\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk’s warrant.”\r\n\r\n“Why, so in sooth I did:  I do remember. . . . What did I with it?...\r\nI am very feeble. . . . So oft these days doth my memory play the\r\ntraitor with me. . . . ’tis strange, strange--”\r\n\r\nThe King dropped into inarticulate mumblings, shaking his grey head\r\nweakly from time to time, and gropingly trying to recollect what he\r\nhad done with the Seal.  At last my Lord Hertford ventured to kneel and\r\noffer information--\r\n\r\n“Sire, if that I may be so bold, here be several that do remember with\r\nme how that you gave the Great Seal into the hands of his highness the\r\nPrince of Wales to keep against the day that--”\r\n\r\n“True, most true!” interrupted the King.  “Fetch it!  Go:  time flieth!”\r\n\r\nLord Hertford flew to Tom, but returned to the King before very long,\r\ntroubled and empty-handed.  He delivered himself to this effect--\r\n\r\n“It grieveth me, my lord the King, to bear so heavy and unwelcome\r\ntidings; but it is the will of God that the prince’s affliction abideth\r\nstill, and he cannot recall to mind that he received the Seal.  So came\r\nI quickly to report, thinking it were waste of precious time, and\r\nlittle worth withal, that any should attempt to search the long array of\r\nchambers and saloons that belong unto his royal high--”\r\n\r\nA groan from the King interrupted the lord at this point.  After a\r\nlittle while his majesty said, with a deep sadness in his tone--\r\n\r\n“Trouble him no more, poor child.  The hand of God lieth heavy upon him,\r\nand my heart goeth out in loving compassion for him, and sorrow that I\r\nmay not bear his burden on mine old trouble-weighted shoulders, and so\r\nbring him peace.”\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes, fell to mumbling, and presently was silent. After\r\na time he opened his eyes again, and gazed vacantly around until his\r\nglance rested upon the kneeling Lord Chancellor. Instantly his face\r\nflushed with wrath--\r\n\r\n“What, thou here yet!  By the glory of God, an’ thou gettest not about\r\nthat traitor’s business, thy mitre shall have holiday the morrow for\r\nlack of a head to grace withal!”\r\n\r\nThe trembling Chancellor answered--\r\n\r\n“Good your Majesty, I cry you mercy!  I but waited for the Seal.”\r\n\r\n“Man, hast lost thy wits?  The small Seal which aforetime I was wont\r\nto take with me abroad lieth in my treasury.  And, since the Great Seal\r\nhath flown away, shall not it suffice?  Hast lost thy wits?  Begone!\r\n And hark ye--come no more till thou do bring his head.”\r\n\r\nThe poor Chancellor was not long in removing himself from this dangerous\r\nvicinity; nor did the commission waste time in giving the royal assent\r\nto the work of the slavish Parliament, and appointing the morrow for the\r\nbeheading of the premier peer of England, the luckless Duke of Norfolk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX. The river pageant.\r\n\r\nAt nine in the evening the whole vast river-front of the palace was\r\nblazing with light.  The river itself, as far as the eye could reach\r\ncitywards, was so thickly covered with watermen’s boats and with\r\npleasure-barges, all fringed with coloured lanterns, and gently agitated\r\nby the waves, that it resembled a glowing and limitless garden of\r\nflowers stirred to soft motion by summer winds.  The grand terrace of\r\nstone steps leading down to the water, spacious enough to mass the army\r\nof a German principality upon, was a picture to see, with its ranks\r\nof royal halberdiers in polished armour, and its troops of brilliantly\r\ncostumed servitors flitting up and down, and to and fro, in the hurry of\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\nPresently a command was given, and immediately all living creatures\r\nvanished from the steps.  Now the air was heavy with the hush of\r\nsuspense and expectancy.  As far as one’s vision could carry, he might\r\nsee the myriads of people in the boats rise up, and shade their eyes\r\nfrom the glare of lanterns and torches, and gaze toward the palace.\r\n\r\nA file of forty or fifty state barges drew up to the steps.  They were\r\nrichly gilt, and their lofty prows and sterns were elaborately carved.\r\nSome of them were decorated with banners and streamers; some with\r\ncloth-of-gold and arras embroidered with coats-of-arms; others with\r\nsilken flags that had numberless little silver bells fastened to them,\r\nwhich shook out tiny showers of joyous music whenever the breezes\r\nfluttered them; others of yet higher pretensions, since they belonged to\r\nnobles in the prince’s immediate service, had their sides picturesquely\r\nfenced with shields gorgeously emblazoned with armorial bearings.  Each\r\nstate barge was towed by a tender.  Besides the rowers, these tenders\r\ncarried each a number of men-at-arms in glossy helmet and breastplate,\r\nand a company of musicians.\r\n\r\nThe advance-guard of the expected procession now appeared in the great\r\ngateway, a troop of halberdiers.  ‘They were dressed in striped hose of\r\nblack and tawny, velvet caps graced at the sides with silver roses, and\r\ndoublets of murrey and blue cloth, embroidered on the front and back\r\nwith the three feathers, the prince’s blazon, woven in gold.  Their\r\nhalberd staves were covered with crimson velvet, fastened with gilt\r\nnails, and ornamented with gold tassels.  Filing off on the right and\r\nleft, they formed two long lines, extending from the gateway of the\r\npalace to the water’s edge.  A thick rayed cloth or carpet was\r\nthen unfolded, and laid down between them by attendants in the\r\ngold-and-crimson liveries of the prince.  This done, a flourish of\r\ntrumpets resounded from within.  A lively prelude arose from the\r\nmusicians on the water; and two ushers with white wands marched with a\r\nslow and stately pace from the portal.  They were followed by an officer\r\nbearing the civic mace, after whom came another carrying the city’s\r\nsword; then several sergeants of the city guard, in their full\r\naccoutrements, and with badges on their sleeves; then the Garter\r\nKing-at-arms, in his tabard; then several Knights of the Bath, each with\r\na white lace on his sleeve; then their esquires; then the judges, in\r\ntheir robes of scarlet and coifs; then the Lord High Chancellor of\r\nEngland, in a robe of scarlet, open before, and purfled with minever;\r\nthen a deputation of aldermen, in their scarlet cloaks; and then the\r\nheads of the different civic companies, in their robes of state. Now\r\ncame twelve French gentlemen, in splendid habiliments, consisting of\r\npourpoints of white damask barred with gold, short mantles of\r\ncrimson velvet lined with violet taffeta, and carnation coloured\r\nhauts-de-chausses, and took their way down the steps.  They were of the\r\nsuite of the French ambassador, and were followed by twelve cavaliers of\r\nthe suite of the Spanish ambassador, clothed in black velvet, unrelieved\r\nby any ornament.  Following these came several great English nobles with\r\ntheir attendants.’\r\n\r\nThere was a flourish of trumpets within; and the Prince’s uncle, the\r\nfuture great Duke of Somerset, emerged from the gateway, arrayed in a\r\n‘doublet of black cloth-of-gold, and a cloak of crimson satin flowered\r\nwith gold, and ribanded with nets of silver.’  He turned, doffed\r\nhis plumed cap, bent his body in a low reverence, and began to step\r\nbackward, bowing at each step.  A prolonged trumpet-blast followed, and\r\na proclamation, “Way for the high and mighty the Lord Edward, Prince of\r\nWales!”  High aloft on the palace walls a long line of red tongues of\r\nflame leapt forth with a thunder-crash; the massed world on the river\r\nburst into a mighty roar of welcome; and Tom Canty, the cause and hero\r\nof it all, stepped into view and slightly bowed his princely head.\r\n\r\nHe was ‘magnificently habited in a doublet of white satin, with a\r\nfront-piece of purple cloth-of-tissue, powdered with diamonds, and edged\r\nwith ermine.  Over this he wore a mantle of white cloth-of-gold, pounced\r\nwith the triple-feathered crest, lined with blue satin, set with pearls\r\nand precious stones, and fastened with a clasp of brilliants.  About his\r\nneck hung the order of the Garter, and several princely foreign orders;’\r\nand wherever light fell upon him jewels responded with a blinding flash.\r\n O Tom Canty, born in a hovel, bred in the gutters of London, familiar\r\nwith rags and dirt and misery, what a spectacle is this!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X. The Prince in the toils.\r\n\r\nWe left John Canty dragging the rightful prince into Offal Court, with\r\na noisy and delighted mob at his heels.  There was but one person in it\r\nwho offered a pleading word for the captive, and he was not heeded; he\r\nwas hardly even heard, so great was the turmoil.  The Prince continued\r\nto struggle for freedom, and to rage against the treatment he was\r\nsuffering, until John Canty lost what little patience was left in him,\r\nand raised his oaken cudgel in a sudden fury over the Prince’s head.\r\n The single pleader for the lad sprang to stop the man’s arm, and the\r\nblow descended upon his own wrist.  Canty roared out--\r\n\r\n“Thou’lt meddle, wilt thou?  Then have thy reward.”\r\n\r\nHis cudgel crashed down upon the meddler’s head:  there was a groan, a\r\ndim form sank to the ground among the feet of the crowd, and the next\r\nmoment it lay there in the dark alone.  The mob pressed on, their\r\nenjoyment nothing disturbed by this episode.\r\n\r\nPresently the Prince found himself in John Canty’s abode, with the door\r\nclosed against the outsiders.  By the vague light of a tallow candle\r\nwhich was thrust into a bottle, he made out the main features of the\r\nloathsome den, and also the occupants of it.  Two frowsy girls and\r\na middle-aged woman cowered against the wall in one corner, with the\r\naspect of animals habituated to harsh usage, and expecting and dreading\r\nit now. From another corner stole a withered hag with streaming grey\r\nhair and malignant eyes.  John Canty said to this one--\r\n\r\n“Tarry!  There’s fine mummeries here.  Mar them not till thou’st enjoyed\r\nthem:  then let thy hand be heavy as thou wilt.  Stand forth, lad.  Now\r\nsay thy foolery again, an thou’st not forgot it. Name thy name.  Who art\r\nthou?”\r\n\r\nThe insulted blood mounted to the little prince’s cheek once more, and\r\nhe lifted a steady and indignant gaze to the man’s face and said--\r\n\r\n“‘Tis but ill-breeding in such as thou to command me to speak.  I tell\r\nthee now, as I told thee before, I am Edward, Prince of Wales, and none\r\nother.”\r\n\r\nThe stunning surprise of this reply nailed the hag’s feet to the floor\r\nwhere she stood, and almost took her breath.  She stared at the Prince\r\nin stupid amazement, which so amused her ruffianly son, that he burst\r\ninto a roar of laughter.  But the effect upon Tom Canty’s mother and\r\nsisters was different.  Their dread of bodily injury gave way at once to\r\ndistress of a different sort.  They ran forward with woe and dismay in\r\ntheir faces, exclaiming--\r\n\r\n“Oh, poor Tom, poor lad!”\r\n\r\nThe mother fell on her knees before the Prince, put her hands upon his\r\nshoulders, and gazed yearningly into his face through her rising tears.\r\nThen she said--\r\n\r\n“Oh, my poor boy!  Thy foolish reading hath wrought its woeful work at\r\nlast, and ta’en thy wit away.  Ah! why did’st thou cleave to it when I\r\nso warned thee ‘gainst it?  Thou’st broke thy mother’s heart.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince looked into her face, and said gently--\r\n\r\n“Thy son is well, and hath not lost his wits, good dame.  Comfort thee:\r\nlet me to the palace where he is, and straightway will the King my\r\nfather restore him to thee.”\r\n\r\n“The King thy father!  Oh, my child! unsay these words that be freighted\r\nwith death for thee, and ruin for all that be near to thee.  Shake of\r\nthis gruesome dream.  Call back thy poor wandering memory.  Look upon\r\nme. Am not I thy mother that bore thee, and loveth thee?”\r\n\r\nThe Prince shook his head and reluctantly said--\r\n\r\n“God knoweth I am loth to grieve thy heart; but truly have I never\r\nlooked upon thy face before.”\r\n\r\nThe woman sank back to a sitting posture on the floor, and, covering her\r\neyes with her hands, gave way to heart-broken sobs and wailings.\r\n\r\n“Let the show go on!” shouted Canty.  “What, Nan!--what, Bet! mannerless\r\nwenches! will ye stand in the Prince’s presence?  Upon your knees, ye\r\npauper scum, and do him reverence!”\r\n\r\nHe followed this with another horse-laugh.  The girls began to plead\r\ntimidly for their brother; and Nan said--\r\n\r\n“An thou wilt but let him to bed, father, rest and sleep will heal his\r\nmadness:  prithee, do.”\r\n\r\n“Do, father,” said Bet; “he is more worn than is his wont.  To-morrow\r\nwill he be himself again, and will beg with diligence, and come not\r\nempty home again.”\r\n\r\nThis remark sobered the father’s joviality, and brought his mind to\r\nbusiness.  He turned angrily upon the Prince, and said--\r\n\r\n“The morrow must we pay two pennies to him that owns this hole; two\r\npennies, mark ye--all this money for a half-year’s rent, else out of\r\nthis we go.  Show what thou’st gathered with thy lazy begging.”\r\n\r\nThe Prince said--\r\n\r\n“Offend me not with thy sordid matters.  I tell thee again I am the\r\nKing’s son.”\r\n\r\nA sounding blow upon the Prince’s shoulder from Canty’s broad palm\r\nsent him staggering into goodwife Canty’s arms, who clasped him to her\r\nbreast, and sheltered him from a pelting rain of cuffs and slaps by\r\ninterposing her own person.  The frightened girls retreated to their\r\ncorner; but the grandmother stepped eagerly forward to assist her son.\r\n The Prince sprang away from Mrs. Canty, exclaiming--\r\n\r\n“Thou shalt not suffer for me, madam.  Let these swine do their will\r\nupon me alone.”\r\n\r\nThis speech infuriated the swine to such a degree that they set about\r\ntheir work without waste of time.  Between them they belaboured the boy\r\nright soundly, and then gave the girls and their mother a beating for\r\nshowing sympathy for the victim.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said Canty, “to bed, all of ye.  The entertainment has tired me.”\r\n\r\nThe light was put out, and the family retired.  As soon as the snorings\r\nof the head of the house and his mother showed that they were asleep,\r\nthe young girls crept to where the Prince lay, and covered him tenderly\r\nfrom the cold with straw and rags; and their mother crept to him also,\r\nand stroked his hair, and cried over him, whispering broken words of\r\ncomfort and compassion in his ear the while.  She had saved a morsel for\r\nhim to eat, also; but the boy’s pains had swept away all appetite--at\r\nleast for black and tasteless crusts.  He was touched by her brave and\r\ncostly defence of him, and by her commiseration; and he thanked her in\r\nvery noble and princely words, and begged her to go to her sleep and try\r\nto forget her sorrows.  And he added that the King his father would not\r\nlet her loyal kindness and devotion go unrewarded.  This return to his\r\n‘madness’ broke her heart anew, and she strained him to her breast again\r\nand again, and then went back, drowned in tears, to her bed.\r\n\r\nAs she lay thinking and mourning, the suggestion began to creep into\r\nher mind that there was an undefinable something about this boy that was\r\nlacking in Tom Canty, mad or sane.  She could not describe it, she could\r\nnot tell just what it was, and yet her sharp mother-instinct seemed to\r\ndetect it and perceive it.  What if the boy were really not her son,\r\nafter all?  Oh, absurd!  She almost smiled at the idea, spite of her\r\ngriefs and troubles.  No matter, she found that it was an idea that\r\nwould not ‘down,’ but persisted in haunting her.  It pursued her, it\r\nharassed her, it clung to her, and refused to be put away or ignored.\r\n At last she perceived that there was not going to be any peace for her\r\nuntil she should devise a test that should prove, clearly and without\r\nquestion, whether this lad was her son or not, and so banish these\r\nwearing and worrying doubts.  Ah, yes, this was plainly the right way\r\nout of the difficulty; therefore she set her wits to work at once to\r\ncontrive that test.  But it was an easier thing to propose than to\r\naccomplish.  She turned over in her mind one promising test after\r\nanother, but was obliged to relinquish them all--none of them were\r\nabsolutely sure, absolutely perfect; and an imperfect one could not\r\nsatisfy her.  Evidently she was racking her head in vain--it seemed\r\nmanifest that she must give the matter up.  While this depressing\r\nthought was passing through her mind, her ear caught the regular\r\nbreathing of the boy, and she knew he had fallen asleep.  And while she\r\nlistened, the measured breathing was broken by a soft, startled\r\ncry, such as one utters in a troubled dream.  This chance occurrence\r\nfurnished her instantly with a plan worth all her laboured tests\r\ncombined.  She at once set herself feverishly, but noiselessly, to work\r\nto relight her candle, muttering to herself, “Had I but seen him _then_,\r\nI should have known!  Since that day, when he was little, that the\r\npowder burst in his face, he hath never been startled of a sudden out of\r\nhis dreams or out of his thinkings, but he hath cast his hand before his\r\neyes, even as he did that day; and not as others would do it, with the\r\npalm inward, but always with the palm turned outward--I have seen it a\r\nhundred times, and it hath never varied nor ever failed.  Yes, I shall\r\nsoon know, now!”\r\n\r\nBy this time she had crept to the slumbering boy’s side, with the\r\ncandle, shaded, in her hand.  She bent heedfully and warily over him,\r\nscarcely breathing in her suppressed excitement, and suddenly flashed\r\nthe light in his face and struck the floor by his ear with her knuckles.\r\n The sleeper’s eyes sprang wide open, and he cast a startled stare about\r\nhim--but he made no special movement with his hands.\r\n\r\nThe poor woman was smitten almost helpless with surprise and grief;\r\nbut she contrived to hide her emotions, and to soothe the boy to sleep\r\nagain; then she crept apart and communed miserably with herself upon\r\nthe disastrous result of her experiment.  She tried to believe that her\r\nTom’s madness had banished this habitual gesture of his; but she could\r\nnot do it.  “No,” she said, “his _hands_ are not mad; they could not\r\nunlearn so old a habit in so brief a time.  Oh, this is a heavy day for\r\nme!”\r\n\r\nStill, hope was as stubborn now as doubt had been before; she could not\r\nbring herself to accept the verdict of the test; she must try the thing\r\nagain--the failure must have been only an accident; so she startled the\r\nboy out of his sleep a second and a third time, at intervals--with the\r\nsame result which had marked the first test; then she dragged herself to\r\nbed, and fell sorrowfully asleep, saying, “But I cannot give him up--oh\r\nno, I cannot, I cannot--he _must_ be my boy!”\r\n\r\nThe poor mother’s interruptions having ceased, and the Prince’s pains\r\nhaving gradually lost their power to disturb him, utter weariness at\r\nlast sealed his eyes in a profound and restful sleep. Hour after hour\r\nslipped away, and still he slept like the dead. Thus four or five hours\r\npassed. Then his stupor began to lighten. Presently, while half asleep\r\nand half awake, he murmured--\r\n\r\n“Sir William!”\r\n\r\nAfter a moment--\r\n\r\n“Ho, Sir William Herbert!  Hie thee hither, and list to the strangest\r\ndream that ever . . . Sir William! dost hear?  Man, I did think me\r\nchanged to a pauper, and . . . Ho there!  Guards! Sir William!  What!\r\nis there no groom of the chamber in waiting? Alack! it shall go hard\r\nwith--”\r\n\r\n“What aileth thee?” asked a whisper near him.  “Who art thou calling?”\r\n\r\n“Sir William Herbert.  Who art thou?”\r\n\r\n“I?  Who should I be, but thy sister Nan?  Oh, Tom, I had forgot!\r\nThou’rt mad yet--poor lad, thou’rt mad yet:  would I had never woke to\r\nknow it again!  But prithee master thy tongue, lest we be all beaten\r\ntill we die!”\r\n\r\nThe startled Prince sprang partly up, but a sharp reminder from his\r\nstiffened bruises brought him to himself, and he sank back among his\r\nfoul straw with a moan and the ejaculation--\r\n\r\n“Alas! it was no dream, then!”\r\n\r\nIn a moment all the heavy sorrow and misery which sleep had banished\r\nwere upon him again, and he realised that he was no longer a petted\r\nprince in a palace, with the adoring eyes of a nation upon him, but\r\na pauper, an outcast, clothed in rags, prisoner in a den fit only for\r\nbeasts, and consorting with beggars and thieves.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his grief he began to be conscious of hilarious noises\r\nand shoutings, apparently but a block or two away.  The next moment\r\nthere were several sharp raps at the door; John Canty ceased from\r\nsnoring and said--\r\n\r\n“Who knocketh?  What wilt thou?”\r\n\r\nA voice answered--\r\n\r\n“Know’st thou who it was thou laid thy cudgel on?”\r\n\r\n“No.  Neither know I, nor care.”\r\n\r\n“Belike thou’lt change thy note eftsoons.  An thou would save thy neck,\r\nnothing but flight may stead thee.  The man is this moment delivering up\r\nthe ghost.  ’Tis the priest, Father Andrew!”\r\n\r\n“God-a-mercy!” exclaimed Canty.  He roused his family, and hoarsely\r\ncommanded, “Up with ye all and fly--or bide where ye are and perish!”\r\n\r\nScarcely five minutes later the Canty household were in the street and\r\nflying for their lives.  John Canty held the Prince by the wrist, and\r\nhurried him along the dark way, giving him this caution in a low voice--\r\n\r\n“Mind thy tongue, thou mad fool, and speak not our name.  I will choose\r\nme a new name, speedily, to throw the law’s dogs off the scent.  Mind\r\nthy tongue, I tell thee!”\r\n\r\nHe growled these words to the rest of the family--\r\n\r\n“If it so chance that we be separated, let each make for London Bridge;\r\nwhoso findeth himself as far as the last linen-draper’s shop on the\r\nbridge, let him tarry there till the others be come, then will we flee\r\ninto Southwark together.”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the party burst suddenly out of darkness into light;\r\nand not only into light, but into the midst of a multitude of singing,\r\ndancing, and shouting people, massed together on the river frontage.\r\nThere was a line of bonfires stretching as far as one could see, up\r\nand down the Thames; London Bridge was illuminated; Southwark Bridge\r\nlikewise; the entire river was aglow with the flash and sheen of\r\ncoloured lights; and constant explosions of fireworks filled the skies\r\nwith an intricate commingling of shooting splendours and a thick rain\r\nof dazzling sparks that almost turned night into day; everywhere were\r\ncrowds of revellers; all London seemed to be at large.\r\n\r\nJohn Canty delivered himself of a furious curse and commanded a retreat;\r\nbut it was too late.  He and his tribe were swallowed up in that\r\nswarming hive of humanity, and hopelessly separated from each other in\r\nan instant. We are not considering that the Prince was one of his tribe;\r\nCanty still kept his grip upon him.  The Prince’s heart was beating high\r\nwith hopes of escape, now.  A burly waterman, considerably exalted with\r\nliquor, found himself rudely shoved by Canty in his efforts to plough\r\nthrough the crowd; he laid his great hand on Canty’s shoulder and said--\r\n\r\n“Nay, whither so fast, friend?  Dost canker thy soul with sordid\r\nbusiness when all that be leal men and true make holiday?”\r\n\r\n“Mine affairs are mine own, they concern thee not,” answered Canty,\r\nroughly; “take away thy hand and let me pass.”\r\n\r\n“Sith that is thy humour, thou’lt _not_ pass, till thou’st drunk to the\r\nPrince of Wales, I tell thee that,” said the waterman, barring the way\r\nresolutely.\r\n\r\n“Give me the cup, then, and make speed, make speed!”\r\n\r\nOther revellers were interested by this time.  They cried out--\r\n\r\n“The loving-cup, the loving-cup! make the sour knave drink the\r\nloving-cup, else will we feed him to the fishes.”\r\n\r\nSo a huge loving-cup was brought; the waterman, grasping it by one of\r\nits handles, and with the other hand bearing up the end of an imaginary\r\nnapkin, presented it in due and ancient form to Canty, who had to grasp\r\nthe opposite handle with one of his hands and take off the lid with the\r\nother, according to ancient custom. This left the Prince hand-free for\r\na second, of course.  He wasted no time, but dived among the forest of\r\nlegs about him and disappeared.  In another moment he could not have\r\nbeen harder to find, under that tossing sea of life, if its billows had\r\nbeen the Atlantic’s and he a lost sixpence.\r\n\r\nHe very soon realised this fact, and straightway busied himself about\r\nhis own affairs without further thought of John Canty.  He quickly\r\nrealised another thing, too.  To wit, that a spurious Prince of Wales\r\nwas being feasted by the city in his stead.  He easily concluded that\r\nthe pauper lad, Tom Canty, had deliberately taken advantage of his\r\nstupendous opportunity and become a usurper.\r\n\r\nTherefore there was but one course to pursue--find his way to the\r\nGuildhall, make himself known, and denounce the impostor.  He also made\r\nup his mind that Tom should be allowed a reasonable time for spiritual\r\npreparation, and then be hanged, drawn and quartered, according to the\r\nlaw and usage of the day in cases of high treason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI. At Guildhall.\r\n\r\nThe royal barge, attended by its gorgeous fleet, took its stately way\r\ndown the Thames through the wilderness of illuminated boats. The air was\r\nladen with music; the river banks were beruffled with joy-flames; the\r\ndistant city lay in a soft luminous glow from its countless invisible\r\nbonfires; above it rose many a slender spire into the sky, incrusted\r\nwith sparkling lights, wherefore in their remoteness they seemed like\r\njewelled lances thrust aloft; as the fleet swept along, it was greeted\r\nfrom the banks with a continuous hoarse roar of cheers and the ceaseless\r\nflash and boom of artillery.\r\n\r\nTo Tom Canty, half buried in his silken cushions, these sounds and this\r\nspectacle were a wonder unspeakably sublime and astonishing. To his\r\nlittle friends at his side, the Princess Elizabeth and the Lady Jane\r\nGrey, they were nothing.\r\n\r\nArrived at the Dowgate, the fleet was towed up the limpid Walbrook\r\n(whose channel has now been for two centuries buried out of sight under\r\nacres of buildings) to Bucklersbury, past houses and under bridges\r\npopulous with merry-makers and brilliantly lighted, and at last came to\r\na halt in a basin where now is Barge Yard, in the centre of the ancient\r\ncity of London.  Tom disembarked, and he and his gallant procession\r\ncrossed Cheapside and made a short march through the Old Jewry and\r\nBasinghall Street to the Guildhall.\r\n\r\nTom and his little ladies were received with due ceremony by the Lord\r\nMayor and the Fathers of the City, in their gold chains and scarlet\r\nrobes of state, and conducted to a rich canopy of state at the head of\r\nthe great hall, preceded by heralds making proclamation, and by the Mace\r\nand the City Sword.  The lords and ladies who were to attend upon Tom\r\nand his two small friends took their places behind their chairs.\r\n\r\nAt a lower table the Court grandees and other guests of noble degree\r\nwere seated, with the magnates of the city; the commoners took places at\r\na multitude of tables on the main floor of the hall.  From their lofty\r\nvantage-ground the giants Gog and Magog, the ancient guardians of the\r\ncity, contemplated the spectacle below them with eyes grown familiar\r\nto it in forgotten generations.  There was a bugle-blast and a\r\nproclamation, and a fat butler appeared in a high perch in the leftward\r\nwall, followed by his servitors bearing with impressive solemnity a\r\nroyal baron of beef, smoking hot and ready for the knife.\r\n\r\nAfter grace, Tom (being instructed) rose--and the whole house with\r\nhim--and drank from a portly golden loving-cup with the Princess\r\nElizabeth; from her it passed to the Lady Jane, and then traversed the\r\ngeneral assemblage.  So the banquet began.\r\n\r\nBy midnight the revelry was at its height.  Now came one of those\r\npicturesque spectacles so admired in that old day.  A description of it\r\nis still extant in the quaint wording of a chronicler who witnessed it:\r\n\r\n‘Space being made, presently entered a baron and an earl appareled after\r\nthe Turkish fashion in long robes of bawdkin powdered with gold; hats on\r\ntheir heads of crimson velvet, with great rolls of gold, girded with two\r\nswords, called scimitars, hanging by great bawdricks of gold.  Next came\r\nyet another baron and another earl, in two long gowns of yellow satin,\r\ntraversed with white satin, and in every bend of white was a bend of\r\ncrimson satin, after the fashion of Russia, with furred hats of gray on\r\ntheir heads; either of them having an hatchet in their hands, and boots\r\nwith pykes’ (points a foot long), ’turned up.  And after them came\r\na knight, then the Lord High Admiral, and with him five nobles, in\r\ndoublets of crimson velvet, voyded low on the back and before to the\r\ncannell-bone, laced on the breasts with chains of silver; and over\r\nthat, short cloaks of crimson satin, and on their heads hats after\r\nthe dancers’ fashion, with pheasants’ feathers in them.  These were\r\nappareled after the fashion of Prussia.  The torchbearers, which were\r\nabout an hundred, were appareled in crimson satin and green, like Moors,\r\ntheir faces black. Next came in a mommarye. Then the minstrels, which\r\nwere disguised, danced; and the lords and ladies did wildly dance also,\r\nthat it was a pleasure to behold.’\r\n\r\nAnd while Tom, in his high seat, was gazing upon this ‘wild’ dancing,\r\nlost in admiration of the dazzling commingling of kaleidoscopic colours\r\nwhich the whirling turmoil of gaudy figures below him presented, the\r\nragged but real little Prince of Wales was proclaiming his rights and\r\nhis wrongs, denouncing the impostor, and clamouring for admission at\r\nthe gates of Guildhall! The crowd enjoyed this episode prodigiously,\r\nand pressed forward and craned their necks to see the small rioter.\r\nPresently they began to taunt him and mock at him, purposely to goad him\r\ninto a higher and still more entertaining fury.  Tears of mortification\r\nsprang to his eyes, but he stood his ground and defied the mob right\r\nroyally.  Other taunts followed, added mockings stung him, and he\r\nexclaimed--\r\n\r\n“I tell ye again, you pack of unmannerly curs, I am the Prince of Wales!\r\nAnd all forlorn and friendless as I be, with none to give me word of\r\ngrace or help me in my need, yet will not I be driven from my ground,\r\nbut will maintain it!”\r\n\r\n“Though thou be prince or no prince, ’tis all one, thou be’st a gallant\r\nlad, and not friendless neither!  Here stand I by thy side to prove\r\nit; and mind I tell thee thou might’st have a worser friend than Miles\r\nHendon and yet not tire thy legs with seeking. Rest thy small jaw, my\r\nchild; I talk the language of these base kennel-rats like to a very\r\nnative.”\r\n\r\nThe speaker was a sort of Don Caesar de Bazan in dress, aspect, and\r\nbearing.  He was tall, trim-built, muscular.  His doublet and trunks\r\nwere of rich material, but faded and threadbare, and their gold-lace\r\nadornments were sadly tarnished; his ruff was rumpled and damaged;\r\nthe plume in his slouched hat was broken and had a bedraggled and\r\ndisreputable look; at his side he wore a long rapier in a rusty iron\r\nsheath; his swaggering carriage marked him at once as a ruffler of\r\nthe camp.  The speech of this fantastic figure was received with an\r\nexplosion of jeers and laughter.  Some cried, “‘Tis another prince in\r\ndisguise!” “‘Ware thy tongue, friend:  belike he is dangerous!”\r\n  “Marry, he looketh it--mark his eye!”  “Pluck the lad from him--to the\r\nhorse-pond wi’ the cub!”\r\n\r\nInstantly a hand was laid upon the Prince, under the impulse of this\r\nhappy thought; as instantly the stranger’s long sword was out and the\r\nmeddler went to the earth under a sounding thump with the flat of it.\r\nThe next moment a score of voices shouted, “Kill the dog!  Kill him!\r\nKill him!” and the mob closed in on the warrior, who backed himself\r\nagainst a wall and began to lay about him with his long weapon like a\r\nmadman.  His victims sprawled this way and that, but the mob-tide poured\r\nover their prostrate forms and dashed itself against the champion with\r\nundiminished fury.\r\n\r\nHis moments seemed numbered, his destruction certain, when suddenly a\r\ntrumpet-blast sounded, a voice shouted, “Way for the King’s messenger!”\r\n and a troop of horsemen came charging down upon the mob, who fled out of\r\nharm’s reach as fast as their legs could carry them. The bold stranger\r\ncaught up the Prince in his arms, and was soon far away from danger and\r\nthe multitude.\r\n\r\nReturn we within the Guildhall.  Suddenly, high above the jubilant roar\r\nand thunder of the revel, broke the clear peal of a bugle-note.  There\r\nwas instant silence--a deep hush; then a single voice rose--that of the\r\nmessenger from the palace--and began to pipe forth a proclamation, the\r\nwhole multitude standing listening.\r\n\r\nThe closing words, solemnly pronounced, were--\r\n\r\n“The King is dead!”\r\n\r\nThe great assemblage bent their heads upon their breasts with one\r\naccord; remained so, in profound silence, a few moments; then all sank\r\nupon their knees in a body, stretched out their hands toward Tom, and a\r\nmighty shout burst forth that seemed to shake the building--\r\n\r\n“Long live the King!”\r\n\r\nPoor Tom’s dazed eyes wandered abroad over this stupefying spectacle,\r\nand finally rested dreamily upon the kneeling princesses beside him, a\r\nmoment, then upon the Earl of Hertford. A sudden purpose dawned in his\r\nface.  He said, in a low tone, at Lord Hertford’s ear--\r\n\r\n“Answer me truly, on thy faith and honour!  Uttered I here a command,\r\nthe which none but a king might hold privilege and prerogative to utter,\r\nwould such commandment be obeyed, and none rise up to say me nay?”\r\n\r\n“None, my liege, in all these realms.  In thy person bides the majesty\r\nof England.  Thou art the king--thy word is law.”\r\n\r\nTom responded, in a strong, earnest voice, and with great animation--\r\n\r\n“Then shall the king’s law be law of mercy, from this day, and never\r\nmore be law of blood!  Up from thy knees and away!  To the Tower, and\r\nsay the King decrees the Duke of Norfolk shall not die!”\r\n\r\nThe words were caught up and carried eagerly from lip to lip far and\r\nwide over the hall, and as Hertford hurried from the presence, another\r\nprodigious shout burst forth--\r\n\r\n“The reign of blood is ended!  Long live Edward, King of England!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII. The Prince and his Deliverer.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Miles Hendon and the little prince were clear of the mob,\r\nthey struck down through back lanes and alleys toward the river.  Their\r\nway was unobstructed until they approached London Bridge; then they\r\nploughed into the multitude again, Hendon keeping a fast grip upon\r\nthe Prince’s--no, the King’s--wrist.  The tremendous news was already\r\nabroad, and the boy learned it from a thousand voices at once--“The King\r\nis dead!”  The tidings struck a chill to the heart of the poor little\r\nwaif, and sent a shudder through his frame.  He realised the greatness\r\nof his loss, and was filled with a bitter grief; for the grim tyrant who\r\nhad been such a terror to others had always been gentle with him.  The\r\ntears sprang to his eyes and blurred all objects.  For an instant\r\nhe felt himself the most forlorn, outcast, and forsaken of God’s\r\ncreatures--then another cry shook the night with its far-reaching\r\nthunders:  “Long live King Edward the Sixth!” and this made his eyes\r\nkindle, and thrilled him with pride to his fingers’ ends. “Ah,” he\r\nthought, “how grand and strange it seems--_I am King_!”\r\n\r\nOur friends threaded their way slowly through the throngs upon the\r\nbridge.  This structure, which had stood for six hundred years, and\r\nhad been a noisy and populous thoroughfare all that time, was a curious\r\naffair, for a closely packed rank of stores and shops, with family\r\nquarters overhead, stretched along both sides of it, from one bank of\r\nthe river to the other.  The Bridge was a sort of town to itself; it\r\nhad its inn, its beer-houses, its bakeries, its haberdasheries, its food\r\nmarkets, its manufacturing industries, and even its church.  It\r\nlooked upon the two neighbours which it linked together--London\r\nand Southwark--as being well enough as suburbs, but not otherwise\r\nparticularly important.  It was a close corporation, so to speak; it was\r\na narrow town, of a single street a fifth of a mile long, its\r\npopulation was but a village population and everybody in it knew all\r\nhis fellow-townsmen intimately, and had known their fathers and mothers\r\nbefore them--and all their little family affairs into the bargain.  It\r\nhad its aristocracy, of course--its fine old families of butchers, and\r\nbakers, and what-not, who had occupied the same old premises for five\r\nor six hundred years, and knew the great history of the Bridge from\r\nbeginning to end, and all its strange legends; and who always talked\r\nbridgy talk, and thought bridgy thoughts, and lied in a long, level,\r\ndirect, substantial bridgy way.  It was just the sort of population to\r\nbe narrow and ignorant and self-conceited. Children were born on the\r\nBridge, were reared there, grew to old age, and finally died without\r\never having set a foot upon any part of the world but London Bridge\r\nalone.  Such people would naturally imagine that the mighty and\r\ninterminable procession which moved through its street night and day,\r\nwith its confused roar of shouts and cries, its neighings and bellowing\r\nand bleatings and its muffled thunder-tramp, was the one great thing in\r\nthis world, and themselves somehow the proprietors of it.  And so they\r\nwere, in effect--at least they could exhibit it from their windows, and\r\ndid--for a consideration--whenever a returning king or hero gave it a\r\nfleeting splendour, for there was no place like it for affording a long,\r\nstraight, uninterrupted view of marching columns.\r\n\r\nMen born and reared upon the Bridge found life unendurably dull and\r\ninane elsewhere.  History tells of one of these who left the Bridge at\r\nthe age of seventy-one and retired to the country.  But he could only\r\nfret and toss in his bed; he could not go to sleep, the deep stillness\r\nwas so painful, so awful, so oppressive.  When he was worn out with it,\r\nat last, he fled back to his old home, a lean and haggard spectre, and\r\nfell peacefully to rest and pleasant dreams under the lulling music of\r\nthe lashing waters and the boom and crash and thunder of London Bridge.\r\n\r\nIn the times of which we are writing, the Bridge furnished ‘object\r\nlessons’ in English history for its children--namely, the livid and\r\ndecaying heads of renowned men impaled upon iron spikes atop of its\r\ngateways.  But we digress.\r\n\r\nHendon’s lodgings were in the little inn on the Bridge.  As he neared\r\nthe door with his small friend, a rough voice said--\r\n\r\n“So, thou’rt come at last!  Thou’lt not escape again, I warrant thee;\r\nand if pounding thy bones to a pudding can teach thee somewhat, thou’lt\r\nnot keep us waiting another time, mayhap,”--and John Canty put out his\r\nhand to seize the boy.\r\n\r\nMiles Hendon stepped in the way and said--\r\n\r\n“Not too fast, friend.  Thou art needlessly rough, methinks.  What is\r\nthe lad to thee?”\r\n\r\n“If it be any business of thine to make and meddle in others’ affairs,\r\nhe is my son.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis a lie!” cried the little King, hotly.\r\n\r\n“Boldly said, and I believe thee, whether thy small headpiece be sound\r\nor cracked, my boy.  But whether this scurvy ruffian be thy father\r\nor no, ’tis all one, he shall not have thee to beat thee and abuse,\r\naccording to his threat, so thou prefer to bide with me.”\r\n\r\n“I do, I do--I know him not, I loathe him, and will die before I will go\r\nwith him.”\r\n\r\n“Then ’tis settled, and there is nought more to say.”\r\n\r\n“We will see, as to that!” exclaimed John Canty, striding past Hendon to\r\nget at the boy; “by force shall he--”\r\n\r\n“If thou do but touch him, thou animated offal, I will spit thee like a\r\ngoose!” said Hendon, barring the way and laying his hand upon his sword\r\nhilt.  Canty drew back.  “Now mark ye,” continued Hendon, “I took this\r\nlad under my protection when a mob of such as thou would have mishandled\r\nhim, mayhap killed him; dost imagine I will desert him now to a worser\r\nfate?--for whether thou art his father or no--and sooth to say, I think\r\nit is a lie--a decent swift death were better for such a lad than life\r\nin such brute hands as thine.  So go thy ways, and set quick about it,\r\nfor I like not much bandying of words, being not over-patient in my\r\nnature.”\r\n\r\nJohn Canty moved off, muttering threats and curses, and was swallowed\r\nfrom sight in the crowd.  Hendon ascended three flights of stairs to his\r\nroom, with his charge, after ordering a meal to be sent thither.  It\r\nwas a poor apartment, with a shabby bed and some odds and ends of old\r\nfurniture in it, and was vaguely lighted by a couple of sickly candles.\r\nThe little King dragged himself to the bed and lay down upon it, almost\r\nexhausted with hunger and fatigue.  He had been on his feet a good\r\npart of a day and a night (for it was now two or three o’clock in the\r\nmorning), and had eaten nothing meantime.  He murmured drowsily--\r\n\r\n“Prithee call me when the table is spread,” and sank into a deep sleep\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nA smile twinkled in Hendon’s eye, and he said to himself--\r\n\r\n“By the mass, the little beggar takes to one’s quarters and usurps one’s\r\nbed with as natural and easy a grace as if he owned them--with never\r\na by-your-leave or so-please-it-you, or anything of the sort.  In his\r\ndiseased ravings he called himself the Prince of Wales, and bravely doth\r\nhe keep up the character.  Poor little friendless rat, doubtless his\r\nmind has been disordered with ill-usage.  Well, I will be his friend;\r\nI have saved him, and it draweth me strongly to him; already I love the\r\nbold-tongued little rascal.  How soldier-like he faced the smutty rabble\r\nand flung back his high defiance!  And what a comely, sweet and gentle\r\nface he hath, now that sleep hath conjured away its troubles and its\r\ngriefs. I will teach him; I will cure his malady; yea, I will be his\r\nelder brother, and care for him and watch over him; and whoso would\r\nshame him or do him hurt may order his shroud, for though I be burnt for\r\nit he shall need it!”\r\n\r\nHe bent over the boy and contemplated him with kind and pitying\r\ninterest, tapping the young cheek tenderly and smoothing back the\r\ntangled curls with his great brown hand.  A slight shiver passed over\r\nthe boy’s form. Hendon muttered--\r\n\r\n“See, now, how like a man it was to let him lie here uncovered and fill\r\nhis body with deadly rheums.  Now what shall I do? ’twill wake him to\r\ntake him up and put him within the bed, and he sorely needeth sleep.”\r\n\r\nHe looked about for extra covering, but finding none, doffed his doublet\r\nand wrapped the lad in it, saying, “I am used to nipping air and scant\r\napparel, ’tis little I shall mind the cold!”--then walked up and down\r\nthe room, to keep his blood in motion, soliloquising as before.\r\n\r\n“His injured mind persuades him he is Prince of Wales; ’twill be odd to\r\nhave a Prince of Wales still with us, now that he that _was_ the prince\r\nis prince no more, but king--for this poor mind is set upon the one\r\nfantasy, and will not reason out that now it should cast by the prince\r\nand call itself the king. . . If my father liveth still, after these\r\nseven years that I have heard nought from home in my foreign dungeon, he\r\nwill welcome the poor lad and give him generous shelter for my sake; so\r\nwill my good elder brother, Arthur; my other brother, Hugh--but I will\r\ncrack his crown an _he_ interfere, the fox-hearted, ill-conditioned\r\nanimal! Yes, thither will we fare--and straightway, too.”\r\n\r\nA servant entered with a smoking meal, disposed it upon a small deal\r\ntable, placed the chairs, and took his departure, leaving such cheap\r\nlodgers as these to wait upon themselves.  The door slammed after him,\r\nand the noise woke the boy, who sprang to a sitting posture, and shot\r\na glad glance about him; then a grieved look came into his face and he\r\nmurmured to himself, with a deep sigh, “Alack, it was but a dream, woe\r\nis me!”  Next he noticed Miles Hendon’s doublet--glanced from that to\r\nHendon, comprehended the sacrifice that had been made for him, and said,\r\ngently--\r\n\r\n“Thou art good to me, yes, thou art very good to me.  Take it and put it\r\non--I shall not need it more.”\r\n\r\nThen he got up and walked to the washstand in the corner and stood\r\nthere, waiting.  Hendon said in a cheery voice--\r\n\r\n“We’ll have a right hearty sup and bite, now, for everything is savoury\r\nand smoking hot, and that and thy nap together will make thee a little\r\nman again, never fear!”\r\n\r\nThe boy made no answer, but bent a steady look, that was filled with\r\ngrave surprise, and also somewhat touched with impatience, upon the tall\r\nknight of the sword.  Hendon was puzzled, and said--\r\n\r\n“What’s amiss?”\r\n\r\n“Good sir, I would wash me.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, is that all?  Ask no permission of Miles Hendon for aught thou\r\ncravest.  Make thyself perfectly free here, and welcome, with all that\r\nare his belongings.”\r\n\r\nStill the boy stood, and moved not; more, he tapped the floor once or\r\ntwice with his small impatient foot.  Hendon was wholly perplexed.  Said\r\nhe--\r\n\r\n“Bless us, what is it?”\r\n\r\n“Prithee pour the water, and make not so many words!”\r\n\r\nHendon, suppressing a horse-laugh, and saying to himself, “By all the\r\nsaints, but this is admirable!” stepped briskly forward and did the\r\nsmall insolent’s bidding; then stood by, in a sort of stupefaction,\r\nuntil the command, “Come--the towel!” woke him sharply up.  He took up a\r\ntowel, from under the boy’s nose, and handed it to him without comment.\r\n He now proceeded to comfort his own face with a wash, and while he was\r\nat it his adopted child seated himself at the table and prepared to fall\r\nto. Hendon despatched his ablutions with alacrity, then drew back the\r\nother chair and was about to place himself at table, when the boy said,\r\nindignantly--\r\n\r\n“Forbear!  Wouldst sit in the presence of the King?”\r\n\r\nThis blow staggered Hendon to his foundations.  He muttered to himself,\r\n“Lo, the poor thing’s madness is up with the time!  It hath changed\r\nwith the great change that is come to the realm, and now in fancy is\r\nhe _king_! Good lack, I must humour the conceit, too--there is no other\r\nway--faith, he would order me to the Tower, else!”\r\n\r\nAnd pleased with this jest, he removed the chair from the table,\r\ntook his stand behind the King, and proceeded to wait upon him in the\r\ncourtliest way he was capable of.\r\n\r\nWhile the King ate, the rigour of his royal dignity relaxed a little,\r\nand with his growing contentment came a desire to talk. He said--“I\r\nthink thou callest thyself Miles Hendon, if I heard thee aright?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sire,” Miles replied; then observed to himself, “If I _must_\r\nhumour the poor lad’s madness, I must ‘Sire’ him, I must ‘Majesty’ him,\r\nI must not go by halves, I must stick at nothing that belongeth to the\r\npart I play, else shall I play it ill and work evil to this charitable\r\nand kindly cause.”\r\n\r\nThe King warmed his heart with a second glass of wine, and said--“I\r\nwould know thee--tell me thy story.  Thou hast a gallant way with thee,\r\nand a noble--art nobly born?”\r\n\r\n“We are of the tail of the nobility, good your Majesty.  My father is\r\na baronet--one of the smaller lords by knight service {2}--Sir Richard\r\nHendon of Hendon Hall, by Monk’s Holm in Kent.”\r\n\r\n“The name has escaped my memory.  Go on--tell me thy story.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis not much, your Majesty, yet perchance it may beguile a short\r\nhalf-hour for want of a better.  My father, Sir Richard, is very rich,\r\nand of a most generous nature.  My mother died whilst I was yet a\r\nboy.  I have two brothers:  Arthur, my elder, with a soul like to\r\nhis father’s; and Hugh, younger than I, a mean spirit, covetous,\r\ntreacherous, vicious, underhanded--a reptile.  Such was he from the\r\ncradle; such was he ten years past, when I last saw him--a ripe rascal\r\nat nineteen, I being twenty then, and Arthur twenty-two.  There is\r\nnone other of us but the Lady Edith, my cousin--she was sixteen\r\nthen--beautiful, gentle, good, the daughter of an earl, the last of her\r\nrace, heiress of a great fortune and a lapsed title.  My father was her\r\nguardian.  I loved her and she loved me; but she was betrothed to Arthur\r\nfrom the cradle, and Sir Richard would not suffer the contract to be\r\nbroken.  Arthur loved another maid, and bade us be of good cheer and\r\nhold fast to the hope that delay and luck together would some day give\r\nsuccess to our several causes.  Hugh loved the Lady Edith’s fortune,\r\nthough in truth he said it was herself he loved--but then ’twas his way,\r\nalway, to say the one thing and mean the other.  But he lost his arts\r\nupon the girl; he could deceive my father, but none else.  My father\r\nloved him best of us all, and trusted and believed him; for he was the\r\nyoungest child, and others hated him--these qualities being in all\r\nages sufficient to win a parent’s dearest love; and he had a smooth\r\npersuasive tongue, with an admirable gift of lying--and these be\r\nqualities which do mightily assist a blind affection to cozen itself.\r\n I was wild--in troth I might go yet farther and say _very_ wild, though\r\n‘twas a wildness of an innocent sort, since it hurt none but me, brought\r\nshame to none, nor loss, nor had in it any taint of crime or baseness,\r\nor what might not beseem mine honourable degree.\r\n\r\n“Yet did my brother Hugh turn these faults to good account--he seeing\r\nthat our brother Arthur’s health was but indifferent, and hoping the\r\nworst might work him profit were I swept out of the path--so--but ’twere\r\na long tale, good my liege, and little worth the telling.  Briefly,\r\nthen, this brother did deftly magnify my faults and make them\r\ncrimes; ending his base work with finding a silken ladder in mine\r\napartments--conveyed thither by his own means--and did convince my\r\nfather by this, and suborned evidence of servants and other lying\r\nknaves, that I was minded to carry off my Edith and marry with her in\r\nrank defiance of his will.\r\n\r\n“Three years of banishment from home and England might make a soldier\r\nand a man of me, my father said, and teach me some degree of wisdom.\r\n I fought out my long probation in the continental wars, tasting\r\nsumptuously of hard knocks, privation, and adventure; but in my last\r\nbattle I was taken captive, and during the seven years that have waxed\r\nand waned since then, a foreign dungeon hath harboured me.  Through wit\r\nand courage I won to the free air at last, and fled hither straight; and\r\nam but just arrived, right poor in purse and raiment, and poorer still\r\nin knowledge of what these dull seven years have wrought at Hendon Hall,\r\nits people and belongings.  So please you, sir, my meagre tale is told.”\r\n\r\n“Thou hast been shamefully abused!” said the little King, with a\r\nflashing eye.  “But I will right thee--by the cross will I!  The King\r\nhath said it.”\r\n\r\nThen, fired by the story of Miles’s wrongs, he loosed his tongue and\r\npoured the history of his own recent misfortunes into the ears of his\r\nastonished listener.  When he had finished, Miles said to himself--\r\n\r\n“Lo, what an imagination he hath!  Verily, this is no common mind; else,\r\ncrazed or sane, it could not weave so straight and gaudy a tale as this\r\nout of the airy nothings wherewith it hath wrought this curious romaunt.\r\nPoor ruined little head, it shall not lack friend or shelter whilst I\r\nbide with the living.  He shall never leave my side; he shall be my\r\npet, my little comrade.  And he shall be cured!--ay, made whole and\r\nsound--then will he make himself a name--and proud shall I be to say,\r\n‘Yes, he is mine--I took him, a homeless little ragamuffin, but I saw\r\nwhat was in him, and I said his name would be heard some day--behold\r\nhim, observe him--was I right?’”\r\n\r\nThe King spoke--in a thoughtful, measured voice--\r\n\r\n“Thou didst save me injury and shame, perchance my life, and so my\r\ncrown. Such service demandeth rich reward.  Name thy desire, and so it\r\nbe within the compass of my royal power, it is thine.”\r\n\r\nThis fantastic suggestion startled Hendon out of his reverie.  He was\r\nabout to thank the King and put the matter aside with saying he had only\r\ndone his duty and desired no reward, but a wiser thought came into his\r\nhead, and he asked leave to be silent a few moments and consider the\r\ngracious offer--an idea which the King gravely approved, remarking that\r\nit was best to be not too hasty with a thing of such great import.\r\n\r\nMiles reflected during some moments, then said to himself, “Yes, that is\r\nthe thing to do--by any other means it were impossible to get at it--and\r\ncertes, this hour’s experience has taught me ’twould be most wearing and\r\ninconvenient to continue it as it is. Yes, I will propose it; ’twas a\r\nhappy accident that I did not throw the chance away.”  Then he dropped\r\nupon one knee and said--\r\n\r\n“My poor service went not beyond the limit of a subject’s simple duty,\r\nand therefore hath no merit; but since your Majesty is pleased to hold\r\nit worthy some reward, I take heart of grace to make petition to this\r\neffect.  Near four hundred years ago, as your grace knoweth, there being\r\nill blood betwixt John, King of England, and the King of France, it was\r\ndecreed that two champions should fight together in the lists, and so\r\nsettle the dispute by what is called the arbitrament of God.  These two\r\nkings, and the Spanish king, being assembled to witness and judge the\r\nconflict, the French champion appeared; but so redoubtable was he, that\r\nour English knights refused to measure weapons with him.  So the matter,\r\nwhich was a weighty one, was like to go against the English monarch by\r\ndefault.  Now in the Tower lay the Lord de Courcy, the mightiest arm in\r\nEngland, stripped of his honours and possessions, and wasting with\r\nlong captivity.  Appeal was made to him; he gave assent, and came forth\r\narrayed for battle; but no sooner did the Frenchman glimpse his huge\r\nframe and hear his famous name but he fled away, and the French king’s\r\ncause was lost.  King John restored De Courcy’s titles and possessions,\r\nand said, ‘Name thy wish and thou shalt have it, though it cost me half\r\nmy kingdom;’ whereat De Courcy, kneeling, as I do now, made answer,\r\n‘This, then, I ask, my liege; that I and my successors may have and\r\nhold the privilege of remaining covered in the presence of the kings of\r\nEngland, henceforth while the throne shall last.’ The boon was granted,\r\nas your Majesty knoweth; and there hath been no time, these four hundred\r\nyears, that that line has failed of an heir; and so, even unto this day,\r\nthe head of that ancient house still weareth his hat or helm before the\r\nKing’s Majesty, without let or hindrance, and this none other may do.\r\n{3} Invoking this precedent in aid of my prayer, I beseech the King to\r\ngrant to me but this one grace and privilege--to my more than sufficient\r\nreward--and none other, to wit:  that I and my heirs, for ever, may\r\n_sit_ in the presence of the Majesty of England!”\r\n\r\n“Rise, Sir Miles Hendon, Knight,” said the King, gravely--giving the\r\naccolade with Hendon’s sword--“rise, and seat thyself.  Thy petition is\r\ngranted.  Whilst England remains, and the crown continues, the privilege\r\nshall not lapse.”\r\n\r\nHis Majesty walked apart, musing, and Hendon dropped into a chair at\r\ntable, observing to himself, “‘Twas a brave thought, and hath wrought\r\nme a mighty deliverance; my legs are grievously wearied. An I had not\r\nthought of that, I must have had to stand for weeks, till my poor lad’s\r\nwits are cured.”  After a little, he went on, “And so I am become a\r\nknight of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows! A most odd and strange\r\nposition, truly, for one so matter-of-fact as I.  I will not laugh--no,\r\nGod forbid, for this thing which is so substanceless to me is _real_ to\r\nhim.  And to me, also, in one way, it is not a falsity, for it reflects\r\nwith truth the sweet and generous spirit that is in him.”  After\r\na pause: “Ah, what if he should call me by my fine title before\r\nfolk!--there’d be a merry contrast betwixt my glory and my raiment!  But\r\nno matter, let him call me what he will, so it please him; I shall be\r\ncontent.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII. The disappearance of the Prince.\r\n\r\nA heavy drowsiness presently fell upon the two comrades.  The King\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n“Remove these rags.”--meaning his clothing.\r\n\r\nHendon disapparelled the boy without dissent or remark, tucked him up in\r\nbed, then glanced about the room, saying to himself, ruefully, “He hath\r\ntaken my bed again, as before--marry, what shall _I_ do?”  The little\r\nKing observed his perplexity, and dissipated it with a word.  He said,\r\nsleepily--\r\n\r\n“Thou wilt sleep athwart the door, and guard it.”  In a moment more he\r\nwas out of his troubles, in a deep slumber.\r\n\r\n“Dear heart, he should have been born a king!” muttered Hendon,\r\nadmiringly; “he playeth the part to a marvel.”\r\n\r\nThen he stretched himself across the door, on the floor, saying\r\ncontentedly--\r\n\r\n“I have lodged worse for seven years; ’twould be but ill gratitude to\r\nHim above to find fault with this.”\r\n\r\nHe dropped asleep as the dawn appeared.  Toward noon he rose, uncovered\r\nhis unconscious ward--a section at a time--and took his measure with a\r\nstring.  The King awoke, just as he had completed his work, complained\r\nof the cold, and asked what he was doing.\r\n\r\n“‘Tis done, now, my liege,” said Hendon; “I have a bit of business\r\noutside, but will presently return; sleep thou again--thou needest it.\r\nThere--let me cover thy head also--thou’lt be warm the sooner.”\r\n\r\nThe King was back in dreamland before this speech was ended. Miles\r\nslipped softly out, and slipped as softly in again, in the course of\r\nthirty or forty minutes, with a complete second-hand suit of boy’s\r\nclothing, of cheap material, and showing signs of wear; but tidy, and\r\nsuited to the season of the year.  He seated himself, and began to\r\noverhaul his purchase, mumbling to himself--\r\n\r\n“A longer purse would have got a better sort, but when one has not the\r\nlong purse one must be content with what a short one may do--\r\n\r\n“‘There was a woman in our town, In our town did dwell--’\r\n\r\n“He stirred, methinks--I must sing in a less thunderous key; ’tis not\r\ngood to mar his sleep, with this journey before him, and he so wearied\r\nout, poor chap . . . This garment--‘tis well enough--a stitch here and\r\nanother one there will set it aright.  This other is better, albeit a\r\nstitch or two will not come amiss in it, likewise . . . _These_ be very\r\ngood and sound, and will keep his small feet warm and dry--an odd new\r\nthing to him, belike, since he has doubtless been used to foot it bare,\r\nwinters and summers the same . . . Would thread were bread, seeing one\r\ngetteth a year’s sufficiency for a farthing, and such a brave big needle\r\nwithout cost, for mere love.  Now shall I have the demon’s own time to\r\nthread it!”\r\n\r\nAnd so he had.  He did as men have always done, and probably always will\r\ndo, to the end of time--held the needle still, and tried to thrust the\r\nthread through the eye, which is the opposite of a woman’s way.  Time\r\nand time again the thread missed the mark, going sometimes on one side\r\nof the needle, sometimes on the other, sometimes doubling up against the\r\nshaft; but he was patient, having been through these experiences before,\r\nwhen he was soldiering.  He succeeded at last, and took up the garment\r\nthat had lain waiting, meantime, across his lap, and began his work.\r\n\r\n“The inn is paid--the breakfast that is to come, included--and there is\r\nwherewithal left to buy a couple of donkeys and meet our little costs\r\nfor the two or three days betwixt this and the plenty that awaits us at\r\nHendon Hall--\r\n\r\n“‘She loved her hus--’\r\n\r\n“Body o’ me!  I have driven the needle under my nail! . . . It matters\r\nlittle--‘tis not a novelty--yet ’tis not a convenience, neither. . . .\r\nWe shall be merry there, little one, never doubt it! Thy troubles will\r\nvanish there, and likewise thy sad distemper--\r\n\r\n“‘She loved her husband dearilee, But another man--’\r\n\r\n“These be noble large stitches!”--holding the garment up and viewing\r\nit admiringly--“they have a grandeur and a majesty that do cause\r\nthese small stingy ones of the tailor-man to look mightily paltry and\r\nplebeian--\r\n\r\n“‘She loved her husband dearilee, But another man he loved she,--’\r\n\r\n“Marry, ’tis done--a goodly piece of work, too, and wrought with\r\nexpedition.  Now will I wake him, apparel him, pour for him, feed him,\r\nand then will we hie us to the mart by the Tabard Inn in Southwark\r\nand--be pleased to rise, my liege!--he answereth not--what ho, my\r\nliege!--of a truth must I profane his sacred person with a touch, sith\r\nhis slumber is deaf to speech.  What!”\r\n\r\nHe threw back the covers--the boy was gone!\r\n\r\nHe stared about him in speechless astonishment for a moment; noticed for\r\nthe first time that his ward’s ragged raiment was also missing; then he\r\nbegan to rage and storm and shout for the innkeeper.  At that moment a\r\nservant entered with the breakfast.\r\n\r\n“Explain, thou limb of Satan, or thy time is come!” roared the man of\r\nwar, and made so savage a spring toward the waiter that this latter\r\ncould not find his tongue, for the instant, for fright and surprise.\r\n “Where is the boy?”\r\n\r\nIn disjointed and trembling syllables the man gave the information\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\n“You were hardly gone from the place, your worship, when a youth came\r\nrunning and said it was your worship’s will that the boy come to you\r\nstraight, at the bridge-end on the Southwark side.  I brought him\r\nhither; and when he woke the lad and gave his message, the lad did\r\ngrumble some little for being disturbed ‘so early,’ as he called it, but\r\nstraightway trussed on his rags and went with the youth, only saying\r\nit had been better manners that your worship came yourself, not sent a\r\nstranger--and so--”\r\n\r\n“And so thou’rt a fool!--a fool and easily cozened--hang all thy breed!\r\nYet mayhap no hurt is done.  Possibly no harm is meant the boy.  I will\r\ngo fetch him.  Make the table ready.  Stay! the coverings of the bed\r\nwere disposed as if one lay beneath them--happened that by accident?”\r\n\r\n“I know not, good your worship.  I saw the youth meddle with them--he\r\nthat came for the boy.”\r\n\r\n“Thousand deaths!  ‘Twas done to deceive me--‘tis plain ’twas done to\r\ngain time.  Hark ye!  Was that youth alone?”\r\n\r\n“All alone, your worship.”\r\n\r\n“Art sure?”\r\n\r\n“Sure, your worship.”\r\n\r\n“Collect thy scattered wits--bethink thee--take time, man.”\r\n\r\nAfter a moment’s thought, the servant said--\r\n\r\n“When he came, none came with him; but now I remember me that as the two\r\nstepped into the throng of the Bridge, a ruffian-looking man plunged out\r\nfrom some near place; and just as he was joining them--”\r\n\r\n“What _then_?--out with it!” thundered the impatient Hendon,\r\ninterrupting.\r\n\r\n“Just then the crowd lapped them up and closed them in, and I saw no\r\nmore, being called by my master, who was in a rage because a joint that\r\nthe scrivener had ordered was forgot, though I take all the saints to\r\nwitness that to blame _me_ for that miscarriage were like holding the\r\nunborn babe to judgment for sins com--”\r\n\r\n“Out of my sight, idiot!  Thy prating drives me mad!  Hold! Whither art\r\nflying?  Canst not bide still an instant?  Went they toward Southwark?”\r\n\r\n“Even so, your worship--for, as I said before, as to that detestable\r\njoint, the babe unborn is no whit more blameless than--”\r\n\r\n“Art here _yet_!  And prating still!  Vanish, lest I throttle thee!” The\r\nservitor vanished.  Hendon followed after him, passed him, and plunged\r\ndown the stairs two steps at a stride, muttering, “‘Tis that scurvy\r\nvillain that claimed he was his son.  I have lost thee, my poor little\r\nmad master--it is a bitter thought--and I had come to love thee so!  No!\r\nby book and bell, _not_ lost!  Not lost, for I will ransack the land\r\ntill I find thee again.  Poor child, yonder is his breakfast--and mine,\r\nbut I have no hunger now; so, let the rats have it--speed, speed! that\r\nis the word!”  As he wormed his swift way through the noisy multitudes\r\nupon the Bridge he several times said to himself--clinging to the\r\nthought as if it were a particularly pleasing one--“He grumbled, but he\r\n_went_--he went, yes, because he thought Miles Hendon asked it, sweet\r\nlad--he would ne’er have done it for another, I know it well.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV. ‘Le Roi est mort--vive le Roi.’\r\n\r\nToward daylight of the same morning, Tom Canty stirred out of a heavy\r\nsleep and opened his eyes in the dark.  He lay silent a few moments,\r\ntrying to analyse his confused thoughts and impressions, and get some\r\nsort of meaning out of them; then suddenly he burst out in a rapturous\r\nbut guarded voice--\r\n\r\n“I see it all, I see it all!  Now God be thanked, I am indeed awake at\r\nlast!  Come, joy! vanish, sorrow!  Ho, Nan! Bet! kick off your straw and\r\nhie ye hither to my side, till I do pour into your unbelieving ears the\r\nwildest madcap dream that ever the spirits of night did conjure up to\r\nastonish the soul of man withal! . . . Ho, Nan, I say!  Bet!”\r\n\r\nA dim form appeared at his side, and a voice said--\r\n\r\n“Wilt deign to deliver thy commands?”\r\n\r\n“Commands? . . . O, woe is me, I know thy voice!  Speak thou--who am I?”\r\n\r\n“Thou?  In sooth, yesternight wert thou the Prince of Wales; to-day art\r\nthou my most gracious liege, Edward, King of England.”\r\n\r\nTom buried his head among his pillows, murmuring plaintively--\r\n\r\n“Alack, it was no dream!  Go to thy rest, sweet sir--leave me to my\r\nsorrows.”\r\n\r\nTom slept again, and after a time he had this pleasant dream.  He\r\nthought it was summer, and he was playing, all alone, in the fair meadow\r\ncalled Goodman’s Fields, when a dwarf only a foot high, with long red\r\nwhiskers and a humped back, appeared to him suddenly and said, “Dig by\r\nthat stump.”  He did so, and found twelve bright new pennies--wonderful\r\nriches!  Yet this was not the best of it; for the dwarf said--\r\n\r\n“I know thee.  Thou art a good lad, and a deserving; thy distresses\r\nshall end, for the day of thy reward is come.  Dig here every seventh\r\nday, and thou shalt find always the same treasure, twelve bright new\r\npennies. Tell none--keep the secret.”\r\n\r\nThen the dwarf vanished, and Tom flew to Offal Court with his prize,\r\nsaying to himself, “Every night will I give my father a penny; he\r\nwill think I begged it, it will glad his heart, and I shall no more\r\nbe beaten. One penny every week the good priest that teacheth me shall\r\nhave; mother, Nan, and Bet the other four. We be done with hunger and\r\nrags, now, done with fears and frets and savage usage.”\r\n\r\nIn his dream he reached his sordid home all out of breath, but with\r\neyes dancing with grateful enthusiasm; cast four of his pennies into his\r\nmother’s lap and cried out--\r\n\r\n“They are for thee!--all of them, every one!--for thee and Nan and\r\nBet--and honestly come by, not begged nor stolen!”\r\n\r\nThe happy and astonished mother strained him to her breast and\r\nexclaimed--\r\n\r\n“It waxeth late--may it please your Majesty to rise?”\r\n\r\nAh! that was not the answer he was expecting.  The dream had snapped\r\nasunder--he was awake.\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes--the richly clad First Lord of the Bedchamber was\r\nkneeling by his couch.  The gladness of the lying dream faded away--the\r\npoor boy recognised that he was still a captive and a king.  The room\r\nwas filled with courtiers clothed in purple mantles--the mourning\r\ncolour--and with noble servants of the monarch.  Tom sat up in bed and\r\ngazed out from the heavy silken curtains upon this fine company.\r\n\r\nThe weighty business of dressing began, and one courtier after another\r\nknelt and paid his court and offered to the little King his condolences\r\nupon his heavy loss, whilst the dressing proceeded.  In the beginning, a\r\nshirt was taken up by the Chief Equerry in Waiting, who passed it to the\r\nFirst Lord of the Buckhounds, who passed it to the Second Gentleman of\r\nthe Bedchamber, who passed it to the Head Ranger of Windsor Forest,\r\nwho passed it to the Third Groom of the Stole, who passed it to the\r\nChancellor Royal of the Duchy of Lancaster, who passed it to the Master\r\nof the Wardrobe, who passed it to Norroy King-at-Arms, who passed it to\r\nthe Constable of the Tower, who passed it to the Chief Steward of the\r\nHousehold, who passed it to the Hereditary Grand Diaperer, who passed it\r\nto the Lord High Admiral of England, who passed it to the Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, who passed it to the First Lord of the Bedchamber, who took\r\nwhat was left of it and put it on Tom.  Poor little wondering chap, it\r\nreminded him of passing buckets at a fire.\r\n\r\nEach garment in its turn had to go through this slow and solemn process;\r\nconsequently Tom grew very weary of the ceremony; so weary that he felt\r\nan almost gushing gratefulness when he at last saw his long silken hose\r\nbegin the journey down the line and knew that the end of the matter\r\nwas drawing near.  But he exulted too soon.  The First Lord of the\r\nBedchamber received the hose and was about to encase Tom’s legs in them,\r\nwhen a sudden flush invaded his face and he hurriedly hustled the things\r\nback into the hands of the Archbishop of Canterbury with an astounded\r\nlook and a whispered, “See, my lord!” pointing to a something connected\r\nwith the hose.  The Archbishop paled, then flushed, and passed the\r\nhose to the Lord High Admiral, whispering, “See, my lord!”  The Admiral\r\npassed the hose to the Hereditary Grand Diaperer, and had hardly breath\r\nenough in his body to ejaculate, “See, my lord!”  The hose drifted\r\nbackward along the line, to the Chief Steward of the Household, the\r\nConstable of the Tower, Norroy King-at-Arms, the Master of the Wardrobe,\r\nthe Chancellor Royal of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Third Groom of the\r\nStole, the Head Ranger of Windsor Forest, the Second Gentleman of the\r\nBedchamber, the First Lord of the Buckhounds,--accompanied always with\r\nthat amazed and frightened “See! see!”--till they finally reached the\r\nhands of the Chief Equerry in Waiting, who gazed a moment, with a pallid\r\nface, upon what had caused all this dismay, then hoarsely whispered,\r\n“Body of my life, a tag gone from a truss-point!--to the Tower with\r\nthe Head Keeper of the King’s Hose!”--after which he leaned upon the\r\nshoulder of the First Lord of the Buckhounds to regather his vanished\r\nstrength whilst fresh hose, without any damaged strings to them, were\r\nbrought.\r\n\r\nBut all things must have an end, and so in time Tom Canty was in a\r\ncondition to get out of bed.  The proper official poured water, the\r\nproper official engineered the washing, the proper official stood by\r\nwith a towel, and by-and-by Tom got safely through the purifying stage\r\nand was ready for the services of the Hairdresser-royal.  When he at\r\nlength emerged from this master’s hands, he was a gracious figure and\r\nas pretty as a girl, in his mantle and trunks of purple satin, and\r\npurple-plumed cap.  He now moved in state toward his breakfast-room,\r\nthrough the midst of the courtly assemblage; and as he passed, these\r\nfell back, leaving his way free, and dropped upon their knees.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast he was conducted, with regal ceremony, attended by his\r\ngreat officers and his guard of fifty Gentlemen Pensioners bearing gilt\r\nbattle-axes, to the throne-room, where he proceeded to transact business\r\nof state.  His ‘uncle,’ Lord Hertford, took his stand by the throne, to\r\nassist the royal mind with wise counsel.\r\n\r\nThe body of illustrious men named by the late King as his executors\r\nappeared, to ask Tom’s approval of certain acts of theirs--rather a\r\nform, and yet not wholly a form, since there was no Protector as yet.\r\n The Archbishop of Canterbury made report of the decree of the Council\r\nof Executors concerning the obsequies of his late most illustrious\r\nMajesty, and finished by reading the signatures of the Executors, to\r\nwit:  the Archbishop of Canterbury; the Lord Chancellor of England;\r\nWilliam Lord St. John; John Lord Russell; Edward Earl of Hertford; John\r\nViscount Lisle; Cuthbert Bishop of Durham--\r\n\r\nTom was not listening--an earlier clause of the document was puzzling\r\nhim.  At this point he turned and whispered to Lord Hertford--\r\n\r\n“What day did he say the burial hath been appointed for?”\r\n\r\n“The sixteenth of the coming month, my liege.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis a strange folly.  Will he keep?”\r\n\r\nPoor chap, he was still new to the customs of royalty; he was used to\r\nseeing the forlorn dead of Offal Court hustled out of the way with a\r\nvery different sort of expedition.  However, the Lord Hertford set his\r\nmind at rest with a word or two.\r\n\r\nA secretary of state presented an order of the Council appointing the\r\nmorrow at eleven for the reception of the foreign ambassadors, and\r\ndesired the King’s assent.\r\n\r\nTom turned an inquiring look toward Hertford, who whispered--\r\n\r\n“Your Majesty will signify consent.  They come to testify their royal\r\nmasters’ sense of the heavy calamity which hath visited your Grace and\r\nthe realm of England.”\r\n\r\nTom did as he was bidden.  Another secretary began to read a preamble\r\nconcerning the expenses of the late King’s household, which had amounted\r\nto 28,000 pounds during the preceding six months--a sum so vast that it\r\nmade Tom Canty gasp; he gasped again when the fact appeared that 20,000\r\npounds of this money was still owing and unpaid; {4} and once more when\r\nit appeared that the King’s coffers were about empty, and his twelve\r\nhundred servants much embarrassed for lack of the wages due them.  Tom\r\nspoke out, with lively apprehension--\r\n\r\n“We be going to the dogs, ’tis plain.  ‘Tis meet and necessary that we\r\ntake a smaller house and set the servants at large, sith they be of no\r\nvalue but to make delay, and trouble one with offices that harass the\r\nspirit and shame the soul, they misbecoming any but a doll, that hath\r\nnor brains nor hands to help itself withal.  I remember me of a small\r\nhouse that standeth over against the fish-market, by Billingsgate--”\r\n\r\nA sharp pressure upon Tom’s arm stopped his foolish tongue and sent a\r\nblush to his face; but no countenance there betrayed any sign that this\r\nstrange speech had been remarked or given concern.\r\n\r\nA secretary made report that forasmuch as the late King had provided in\r\nhis will for conferring the ducal degree upon the Earl of Hertford and\r\nraising his brother, Sir Thomas Seymour, to the peerage, and likewise\r\nHertford’s son to an earldom, together with similar aggrandisements to\r\nother great servants of the Crown, the Council had resolved to hold a\r\nsitting on the 16th of February for the delivering and confirming of\r\nthese honours, and that meantime, the late King not having granted,\r\nin writing, estates suitable to the support of these dignities, the\r\nCouncil, knowing his private wishes in that regard, had thought proper\r\nto grant to Seymour ‘500 pound lands,’ and to Hertford’s son ‘800\r\npound lands, and 300 pound of the next bishop’s lands which should fall\r\nvacant,’--his present Majesty being willing. {5}\r\n\r\nTom was about to blurt out something about the propriety of paying the\r\nlate King’s debts first, before squandering all this money, but a\r\ntimely touch upon his arm, from the thoughtful Hertford, saved him\r\nthis indiscretion; wherefore he gave the royal assent, without spoken\r\ncomment, but with much inward discomfort.  While he sat reflecting a\r\nmoment over the ease with which he was doing strange and glittering\r\nmiracles, a happy thought shot into his mind:  why not make his mother\r\nDuchess of Offal Court, and give her an estate?  But a sorrowful\r\nthought swept it instantly away: he was only a king in name, these grave\r\nveterans and great nobles were his masters; to them his mother was only\r\nthe creature of a diseased mind; they would simply listen to his project\r\nwith unbelieving ears, then send for the doctor.\r\n\r\nThe dull work went tediously on.  Petitions were read, and\r\nproclamations, patents, and all manner of wordy, repetitious, and\r\nwearisome papers relating to the public business; and at last Tom sighed\r\npathetically and murmured to himself, “In what have I offended, that the\r\ngood God should take me away from the fields and the free air and the\r\nsunshine, to shut me up here and make me a king and afflict me so?”\r\n  Then his poor muddled head nodded a while and presently drooped to his\r\nshoulder; and the business of the empire came to a standstill for want\r\nof that august factor, the ratifying power.  Silence ensued around\r\nthe slumbering child, and the sages of the realm ceased from their\r\ndeliberations.\r\n\r\nDuring the forenoon, Tom had an enjoyable hour, by permission of his\r\nkeepers, Hertford and St. John, with the Lady Elizabeth and the little\r\nLady Jane Grey; though the spirits of the princesses were rather subdued\r\nby the mighty stroke that had fallen upon the royal house; and at the\r\nend of the visit his ‘elder sister’--afterwards the ‘Bloody Mary’ of\r\nhistory--chilled him with a solemn interview which had but one merit in\r\nhis eyes, its brevity.  He had a few moments to himself, and then a slim\r\nlad of about twelve years of age was admitted to his presence, whose\r\nclothing, except his snowy ruff and the laces about his wrists, was of\r\nblack,--doublet, hose, and all.  He bore no badge of mourning but a knot\r\nof purple ribbon on his shoulder.  He advanced hesitatingly, with head\r\nbowed and bare, and dropped upon one knee in front of Tom. Tom sat still\r\nand contemplated him soberly a moment.  Then he said--\r\n\r\n“Rise, lad.  Who art thou.  What wouldst have?”\r\n\r\nThe boy rose, and stood at graceful ease, but with an aspect of concern\r\nin his face.  He said--\r\n\r\n“Of a surety thou must remember me, my lord.  I am thy whipping-boy.”\r\n\r\n“My _whipping_-boy?”\r\n\r\n“The same, your Grace.  I am Humphrey--Humphrey Marlow.”\r\n\r\nTom perceived that here was someone whom his keepers ought to have\r\nposted him about.  The situation was delicate.  What should he\r\ndo?--pretend he knew this lad, and then betray by his every utterance\r\nthat he had never heard of him before?  No, that would not do.  An idea\r\ncame to his relief: accidents like this might be likely to happen with\r\nsome frequency, now that business urgencies would often call Hertford\r\nand St. John from his side, they being members of the Council of\r\nExecutors; therefore perhaps it would be well to strike out a plan\r\nhimself to meet the requirements of such emergencies.  Yes, that would\r\nbe a wise course--he would practise on this boy, and see what sort of\r\nsuccess he might achieve.  So he stroked his brow perplexedly a moment\r\nor two, and presently said--\r\n\r\n“Now I seem to remember thee somewhat--but my wit is clogged and dim\r\nwith suffering--”\r\n\r\n“Alack, my poor master!” ejaculated the whipping-boy, with feeling;\r\nadding, to himself, “In truth ’tis as they said--his mind is gone--alas,\r\npoor soul!  But misfortune catch me, how am I forgetting!  They said one\r\nmust not seem to observe that aught is wrong with him.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis strange how my memory doth wanton with me these days,” said Tom.\r\n“But mind it not--I mend apace--a little clue doth often serve to bring\r\nme back again the things and names which had escaped me.  (And not they,\r\nonly, forsooth, but e’en such as I ne’er heard before--as this lad shall\r\nsee.)  Give thy business speech.”\r\n\r\n“‘Tis matter of small weight, my liege, yet will I touch upon it, an’ it\r\nplease your Grace.  Two days gone by, when your Majesty faulted thrice\r\nin your Greek--in the morning lessons,--dost remember it?”\r\n\r\n“Y-e-s--methinks I do.  (It is not much of a lie--an’ I had meddled with\r\nthe Greek at all, I had not faulted simply thrice, but forty times.)\r\nYes, I do recall it, now--go on.”\r\n\r\n“The master, being wroth with what he termed such slovenly and doltish\r\nwork, did promise that he would soundly whip me for it--and--”\r\n\r\n“Whip _thee_!” said Tom, astonished out of his presence of mind. “Why\r\nshould he whip _thee_ for faults of mine?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, your Grace forgetteth again.  He always scourgeth me when thou dost\r\nfail in thy lessons.”\r\n\r\n“True, true--I had forgot.  Thou teachest me in private--then if I fail,\r\nhe argueth that thy office was lamely done, and--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my liege, what words are these?  I, the humblest of thy servants,\r\npresume to teach _thee_?”\r\n\r\n“Then where is thy blame?  What riddle is this?  Am I in truth gone mad,\r\nor is it thou?  Explain--speak out.”\r\n\r\n“But, good your Majesty, there’s nought that needeth simplifying.--None\r\nmay visit the sacred person of the Prince of Wales with blows;\r\nwherefore, when he faulteth, ’tis I that take them; and meet it is and\r\nright, for that it is mine office and my livelihood.” {1}\r\n\r\nTom stared at the tranquil boy, observing to himself, “Lo, it is a\r\nwonderful thing,--a most strange and curious trade; I marvel they have\r\nnot hired a boy to take my combings and my dressings for me--would\r\nheaven they would!--an’ they will do this thing, I will take my lashings\r\nin mine own person, giving God thanks for the change.” Then he said\r\naloud--\r\n\r\n“And hast thou been beaten, poor friend, according to the promise?”\r\n\r\n“No, good your Majesty, my punishment was appointed for this day, and\r\nperadventure it may be annulled, as unbefitting the season of mourning\r\nthat is come upon us; I know not, and so have made bold to come hither\r\nand remind your Grace about your gracious promise to intercede in my\r\nbehalf--”\r\n\r\n“With the master?  To save thee thy whipping?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, thou dost remember!”\r\n\r\n“My memory mendeth, thou seest.  Set thy mind at ease--thy back shall go\r\nunscathed--I will see to it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, thanks, my good lord!” cried the boy, dropping upon his knee again.\r\n“Mayhap I have ventured far enow; and yet--”\r\n\r\nSeeing Master Humphrey hesitate, Tom encouraged him to go on, saying he\r\nwas “in the granting mood.”\r\n\r\n“Then will I speak it out, for it lieth near my heart.  Sith thou art\r\nno more Prince of Wales but King, thou canst order matters as thou wilt,\r\nwith none to say thee nay; wherefore it is not in reason that thou wilt\r\nlonger vex thyself with dreary studies, but wilt burn thy books and\r\nturn thy mind to things less irksome. Then am I ruined, and mine orphan\r\nsisters with me!”\r\n\r\n“Ruined?  Prithee how?”\r\n\r\n“My back is my bread, O my gracious liege! if it go idle, I starve.  An’\r\nthou cease from study mine office is gone thou’lt need no whipping-boy.\r\nDo not turn me away!”\r\n\r\nTom was touched with this pathetic distress.  He said, with a right\r\nroyal burst of generosity--\r\n\r\n“Discomfort thyself no further, lad.  Thine office shall be permanent in\r\nthee and thy line for ever.”  Then he struck the boy a light blow on the\r\nshoulder with the flat of his sword, exclaiming, “Rise, Humphrey Marlow,\r\nHereditary Grand Whipping-Boy to the Royal House of England!  Banish\r\nsorrow--I will betake me to my books again, and study so ill that they\r\nmust in justice treble thy wage, so mightily shall the business of thine\r\noffice be augmented.”\r\n\r\nThe grateful Humphrey responded fervidly--\r\n\r\n“Thanks, O most noble master, this princely lavishness doth far surpass\r\nmy most distempered dreams of fortune.  Now shall I be happy all my\r\ndays, and all the house of Marlow after me.”\r\n\r\nTom had wit enough to perceive that here was a lad who could be useful\r\nto him.  He encouraged Humphrey to talk, and he was nothing loath.\r\n He was delighted to believe that he was helping in Tom’s ‘cure’; for\r\nalways, as soon as he had finished calling back to Tom’s diseased mind\r\nthe various particulars of his experiences and adventures in the royal\r\nschool-room and elsewhere about the palace, he noticed that Tom was then\r\nable to ‘recall’ the circumstances quite clearly.  At the end of an\r\nhour Tom found himself well freighted with very valuable information\r\nconcerning personages and matters pertaining to the Court; so he\r\nresolved to draw instruction from this source daily; and to this end he\r\nwould give order to admit Humphrey to the royal closet whenever he might\r\ncome, provided the Majesty of England was not engaged with other people.\r\n Humphrey had hardly been dismissed when my Lord Hertford arrived with\r\nmore trouble for Tom.\r\n\r\nHe said that the Lords of the Council, fearing that some overwrought\r\nreport of the King’s damaged health might have leaked out and got\r\nabroad, they deemed it wise and best that his Majesty should begin to\r\ndine in public after a day or two--his wholesome complexion and vigorous\r\nstep, assisted by a carefully guarded repose of manner and ease and\r\ngrace of demeanour, would more surely quiet the general pulse--in case\r\nany evil rumours _had_ gone about--than any other scheme that could be\r\ndevised.\r\n\r\nThen the Earl proceeded, very delicately, to instruct Tom as to the\r\nobservances proper to the stately occasion, under the rather thin\r\ndisguise of ‘reminding’ him concerning things already known to him; but\r\nto his vast gratification it turned out that Tom needed very little help\r\nin this line--he had been making use of Humphrey in that direction, for\r\nHumphrey had mentioned that within a few days he was to begin to dine\r\nin public; having gathered it from the swift-winged gossip of the Court.\r\nTom kept these facts to himself, however.\r\n\r\nSeeing the royal memory so improved, the Earl ventured to apply a\r\nfew tests to it, in an apparently casual way, to find out how far its\r\namendment had progressed.  The results were happy, here and there, in\r\nspots--spots where Humphrey’s tracks remained--and on the whole my lord\r\nwas greatly pleased and encouraged.  So encouraged was he, indeed, that\r\nhe spoke up and said in a quite hopeful voice--\r\n\r\n“Now am I persuaded that if your Majesty will but tax your memory yet\r\na little further, it will resolve the puzzle of the Great Seal--a loss\r\nwhich was of moment yesterday, although of none to-day, since its term\r\nof service ended with our late lord’s life. May it please your Grace to\r\nmake the trial?”\r\n\r\nTom was at sea--a Great Seal was something which he was totally\r\nunacquainted with.  After a moment’s hesitation he looked up innocently\r\nand asked--\r\n\r\n“What was it like, my lord?”\r\n\r\nThe Earl started, almost imperceptibly, muttering to himself, “Alack,\r\nhis wits are flown again!--it was ill wisdom to lead him on to strain\r\nthem”--then he deftly turned the talk to other matters, with the purpose\r\nof sweeping the unlucky seal out of Tom’s thoughts--a purpose which\r\neasily succeeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV. Tom as King.\r\n\r\nThe next day the foreign ambassadors came, with their gorgeous trains;\r\nand Tom, throned in awful state, received them.  The splendours of the\r\nscene delighted his eye and fired his imagination at first, but\r\nthe audience was long and dreary, and so were most of the\r\naddresses--wherefore, what began as a pleasure grew into weariness and\r\nhome-sickness by-and-by.  Tom said the words which Hertford put into\r\nhis mouth from time to time, and tried hard to acquit himself\r\nsatisfactorily, but he was too new to such things, and too ill at ease\r\nto accomplish more than a tolerable success.  He looked sufficiently\r\nlike a king, but he was ill able to feel like one.  He was cordially\r\nglad when the ceremony was ended.\r\n\r\nThe larger part of his day was ‘wasted’--as he termed it, in his own\r\nmind--in labours pertaining to his royal office.  Even the two hours\r\ndevoted to certain princely pastimes and recreations were rather a\r\nburden to him than otherwise, they were so fettered by restrictions\r\nand ceremonious observances.  However, he had a private hour with\r\nhis whipping-boy which he counted clear gain, since he got both\r\nentertainment and needful information out of it.\r\n\r\nThe third day of Tom Canty’s kingship came and went much as the others\r\nhad done, but there was a lifting of his cloud in one way--he felt\r\nless uncomfortable than at first; he was getting a little used to his\r\ncircumstances and surroundings; his chains still galled, but not all the\r\ntime; he found that the presence and homage of the great afflicted and\r\nembarrassed him less and less sharply with every hour that drifted over\r\nhis head.\r\n\r\nBut for one single dread, he could have seen the fourth day approach\r\nwithout serious distress--the dining in public; it was to begin that\r\nday. There were greater matters in the programme--for on that day\r\nhe would have to preside at a council which would take his views and\r\ncommands concerning the policy to be pursued toward various foreign\r\nnations scattered far and near over the great globe; on that day, too,\r\nHertford would be formally chosen to the grand office of Lord Protector;\r\nother things of note were appointed for that fourth day, also; but to\r\nTom they were all insignificant compared with the ordeal of dining all\r\nby himself with a multitude of curious eyes fastened upon him and a\r\nmultitude of mouths whispering comments upon his performance,--and upon\r\nhis mistakes, if he should be so unlucky as to make any.\r\n\r\nStill, nothing could stop that fourth day, and so it came.  It found\r\npoor Tom low-spirited and absent-minded, and this mood continued; he\r\ncould not shake it off.  The ordinary duties of the morning dragged upon\r\nhis hands, and wearied him.  Once more he felt the sense of captivity\r\nheavy upon him.\r\n\r\nLate in the forenoon he was in a large audience-chamber, conversing\r\nwith the Earl of Hertford and dully awaiting the striking of the hour\r\nappointed for a visit of ceremony from a considerable number of great\r\nofficials and courtiers.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while, Tom, who had wandered to a window and become\r\ninterested in the life and movement of the great highway beyond the\r\npalace gates--and not idly interested, but longing with all his heart\r\nto take part in person in its stir and freedom--saw the van of a hooting\r\nand shouting mob of disorderly men, women, and children of the lowest\r\nand poorest degree approaching from up the road.\r\n\r\n“I would I knew what ’tis about!” he exclaimed, with all a boy’s\r\ncuriosity in such happenings.\r\n\r\n“Thou art the King!” solemnly responded the Earl, with a reverence.\r\n“Have I your Grace’s leave to act?”\r\n\r\n“O blithely, yes!  O gladly, yes!” exclaimed Tom excitedly, adding to\r\nhimself with a lively sense of satisfaction, “In truth, being a king is\r\nnot all dreariness--it hath its compensations and conveniences.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl called a page, and sent him to the captain of the guard with\r\nthe order--\r\n\r\n“Let the mob be halted, and inquiry made concerning the occasion of its\r\nmovement.  By the King’s command!”\r\n\r\nA few seconds later a long rank of the royal guards, cased in flashing\r\nsteel, filed out at the gates and formed across the highway in front\r\nof the multitude.  A messenger returned, to report that the crowd were\r\nfollowing a man, a woman, and a young girl to execution for crimes\r\ncommitted against the peace and dignity of the realm.\r\n\r\nDeath--and a violent death--for these poor unfortunates!  The thought\r\nwrung Tom’s heart-strings.  The spirit of compassion took control of\r\nhim, to the exclusion of all other considerations; he never thought of\r\nthe offended laws, or of the grief or loss which these three criminals\r\nhad inflicted upon their victims; he could think of nothing but the\r\nscaffold and the grisly fate hanging over the heads of the condemned.\r\n His concern made him even forget, for the moment, that he was but the\r\nfalse shadow of a king, not the substance; and before he knew it he had\r\nblurted out the command--\r\n\r\n“Bring them here!”\r\n\r\nThen he blushed scarlet, and a sort of apology sprung to his lips; but\r\nobserving that his order had wrought no sort of surprise in the Earl or\r\nthe waiting page, he suppressed the words he was about to utter.  The\r\npage, in the most matter-of-course way, made a profound obeisance\r\nand retired backwards out of the room to deliver the command.  Tom\r\nexperienced a glow of pride and a renewed sense of the compensating\r\nadvantages of the kingly office. He said to himself, “Truly it is like\r\nwhat I was used to feel when I read the old priest’s tales, and did\r\nimagine mine own self a prince, giving law and command to all, saying\r\n‘Do this, do that,’ whilst none durst offer let or hindrance to my\r\nwill.”\r\n\r\nNow the doors swung open; one high-sounding title after another was\r\nannounced, the personages owning them followed, and the place was\r\nquickly half-filled with noble folk and finery.  But Tom was hardly\r\nconscious of the presence of these people, so wrought up was he and so\r\nintensely absorbed in that other and more interesting matter.  He seated\r\nhimself absently in his chair of state, and turned his eyes upon the\r\ndoor with manifestations of impatient expectancy; seeing which, the\r\ncompany forbore to trouble him, and fell to chatting a mixture of public\r\nbusiness and court gossip one with another.\r\n\r\nIn a little while the measured tread of military men was heard\r\napproaching, and the culprits entered the presence in charge of an\r\nunder-sheriff and escorted by a detail of the king’s guard.  The civil\r\nofficer knelt before Tom, then stood aside; the three doomed persons\r\nknelt, also, and remained so; the guard took position behind Tom’s\r\nchair.  Tom scanned the prisoners curiously. Something about the dress\r\nor appearance of the man had stirred a vague memory in him.  “Methinks\r\nI have seen this man ere now . . . but the when or the where fail\r\nme.”--Such was Tom’s thought. Just then the man glanced quickly up and\r\nquickly dropped his face again, not being able to endure the awful port\r\nof sovereignty; but the one full glimpse of the face which Tom got was\r\nsufficient.  He said to himself: “Now is the matter clear; this is the\r\nstranger that plucked Giles Witt out of the Thames, and saved his life,\r\nthat windy, bitter, first day of the New Year--a brave good deed--pity\r\nhe hath been doing baser ones and got himself in this sad case . . . I\r\nhave not forgot the day, neither the hour; by reason that an hour after,\r\nupon the stroke of eleven, I did get a hiding by the hand of Gammer\r\nCanty which was of so goodly and admired severity that all that\r\nwent before or followed after it were but fondlings and caresses by\r\ncomparison.”\r\n\r\nTom now ordered that the woman and the girl be removed from the presence\r\nfor a little time; then addressed himself to the under-sheriff, saying--\r\n\r\n“Good sir, what is this man’s offence?”\r\n\r\nThe officer knelt, and answered--\r\n\r\n“So please your Majesty, he hath taken the life of a subject by poison.”\r\n\r\nTom’s compassion for the prisoner, and admiration of him as the daring\r\nrescuer of a drowning boy, experienced a most damaging shock.\r\n\r\n“The thing was proven upon him?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Most clearly, sire.”\r\n\r\nTom sighed, and said--\r\n\r\n“Take him away--he hath earned his death.  ‘Tis a pity, for he was a\r\nbrave heart--na--na, I mean he hath the _look_ of it!”\r\n\r\nThe prisoner clasped his hands together with sudden energy, and wrung\r\nthem despairingly, at the same time appealing imploringly to the ‘King’\r\nin broken and terrified phrases--\r\n\r\n“O my lord the King, an’ thou canst pity the lost, have pity upon me!  I\r\nam innocent--neither hath that wherewith I am charged been more than\r\nbut lamely proved--yet I speak not of that; the judgment is gone forth\r\nagainst me and may not suffer alteration; yet in mine extremity I beg a\r\nboon, for my doom is more than I can bear. A grace, a grace, my lord the\r\nKing! in thy royal compassion grant my prayer--give commandment that I\r\nbe hanged!”\r\n\r\nTom was amazed.  This was not the outcome he had looked for.\r\n\r\n“Odds my life, a strange _boon_!  Was it not the fate intended thee?”\r\n\r\n“O good my liege, not so!  It is ordered that I be _boiled alive_!”\r\n\r\nThe hideous surprise of these words almost made Tom spring from his\r\nchair.  As soon as he could recover his wits he cried out--\r\n\r\n“Have thy wish, poor soul! an’ thou had poisoned a hundred men thou\r\nshouldst not suffer so miserable a death.”\r\n\r\nThe prisoner bowed his face to the ground and burst into passionate\r\nexpressions of gratitude--ending with--\r\n\r\n“If ever thou shouldst know misfortune--which God forefend!--may thy\r\ngoodness to me this day be remembered and requited!”\r\n\r\nTom turned to the Earl of Hertford, and said--\r\n\r\n“My lord, is it believable that there was warrant for this man’s\r\nferocious doom?”\r\n\r\n“It is the law, your Grace--for poisoners.  In Germany coiners be boiled\r\nto death in _oil_--not cast in of a sudden, but by a rope let down into\r\nthe oil by degrees, and slowly; first the feet, then the legs, then--”\r\n\r\n“O prithee no more, my lord, I cannot bear it!” cried Tom, covering\r\nhis eyes with his hands to shut out the picture.  “I beseech your good\r\nlordship that order be taken to change this law--oh, let no more poor\r\ncreatures be visited with its tortures.”\r\n\r\nThe Earl’s face showed profound gratification, for he was a man of\r\nmerciful and generous impulses--a thing not very common with his class\r\nin that fierce age.  He said--\r\n\r\n“These your Grace’s noble words have sealed its doom.  History will\r\nremember it to the honour of your royal house.”\r\n\r\nThe under-sheriff was about to remove his prisoner; Tom gave him a sign\r\nto wait; then he said--\r\n\r\n“Good sir, I would look into this matter further.  The man has said his\r\ndeed was but lamely proved.  Tell me what thou knowest.”\r\n\r\n“If the King’s grace please, it did appear upon the trial that this\r\nman entered into a house in the hamlet of Islington where one lay\r\nsick--three witnesses say it was at ten of the clock in the morning, and\r\ntwo say it was some minutes later--the sick man being alone at the time,\r\nand sleeping--and presently the man came forth again and went his\r\nway.  The sick man died within the hour, being torn with spasms and\r\nretchings.”\r\n\r\n“Did any see the poison given?  Was poison found?”\r\n\r\n“Marry, no, my liege.”\r\n\r\n“Then how doth one know there was poison given at all?”\r\n\r\n“Please your Majesty, the doctors testified that none die with such\r\nsymptoms but by poison.”\r\n\r\nWeighty evidence, this, in that simple age.  Tom recognised its\r\nformidable nature, and said--\r\n\r\n“The doctor knoweth his trade--belike they were right.  The matter hath\r\nan ill-look for this poor man.”\r\n\r\n“Yet was not this all, your Majesty; there is more and worse. Many\r\ntestified that a witch, since gone from the village, none know whither,\r\ndid foretell, and speak it privately in their ears, that the sick\r\nman _would die by poison_--and more, that a stranger would give it--a\r\nstranger with brown hair and clothed in a worn and common garb; and\r\nsurely this prisoner doth answer woundily to the bill.  Please your\r\nMajesty to give the circumstance that solemn weight which is its due,\r\nseeing it was _foretold_.”\r\n\r\nThis was an argument of tremendous force in that superstitious day.  Tom\r\nfelt that the thing was settled; if evidence was worth anything, this\r\npoor fellow’s guilt was proved.  Still he offered the prisoner a chance,\r\nsaying--\r\n\r\n“If thou canst say aught in thy behalf, speak.”\r\n\r\n“Nought that will avail, my King.  I am innocent, yet cannot I make\r\nit appear.  I have no friends, else might I show that I was not in\r\nIslington that day; so also might I show that at that hour they name I\r\nwas above a league away, seeing I was at Wapping Old Stairs; yea more,\r\nmy King, for I could show, that whilst they say I was _taking_ life, I\r\nwas _saving_ it.  A drowning boy--”\r\n\r\n“Peace!  Sheriff, name the day the deed was done!”\r\n\r\n“At ten in the morning, or some minutes later, the first day of the New\r\nYear, most illustrious--”\r\n\r\n“Let the prisoner go free--it is the King’s will!”\r\n\r\nAnother blush followed this unregal outburst, and he covered his\r\nindecorum as well as he could by adding--\r\n\r\n“It enrageth me that a man should be hanged upon such idle, hare-brained\r\nevidence!”\r\n\r\nA low buzz of admiration swept through the assemblage.  It was not\r\nadmiration of the decree that had been delivered by Tom, for the\r\npropriety or expediency of pardoning a convicted poisoner was a thing\r\nwhich few there would have felt justified in either admitting or\r\nadmiring--no, the admiration was for the intelligence and spirit which\r\nTom had displayed.  Some of the low-voiced remarks were to this effect--\r\n\r\n“This is no mad king--he hath his wits sound.”\r\n\r\n“How sanely he put his questions--how like his former natural self was\r\nthis abrupt imperious disposal of the matter!”\r\n\r\n“God be thanked, his infirmity is spent!  This is no weakling, but a\r\nking.  He hath borne himself like to his own father.”\r\n\r\nThe air being filled with applause, Tom’s ear necessarily caught a\r\nlittle of it.  The effect which this had upon him was to put him\r\ngreatly at his ease, and also to charge his system with very gratifying\r\nsensations.\r\n\r\nHowever, his juvenile curiosity soon rose superior to these pleasant\r\nthoughts and feelings; he was eager to know what sort of deadly mischief\r\nthe woman and the little girl could have been about; so, by his command,\r\nthe two terrified and sobbing creatures were brought before him.\r\n\r\n“What is it that these have done?” he inquired of the sheriff.\r\n\r\n“Please your Majesty, a black crime is charged upon them, and clearly\r\nproven; wherefore the judges have decreed, according to the law, that\r\nthey be hanged.  They sold themselves to the devil--such is their\r\ncrime.”\r\n\r\nTom shuddered.  He had been taught to abhor people who did this wicked\r\nthing.  Still, he was not going to deny himself the pleasure of feeding\r\nhis curiosity for all that; so he asked--\r\n\r\n“Where was this done?--and when?”\r\n\r\n“On a midnight in December, in a ruined church, your Majesty.”\r\n\r\nTom shuddered again.\r\n\r\n“Who was there present?”\r\n\r\n“Only these two, your grace--and _that other_.”\r\n\r\n“Have these confessed?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, not so, sire--they do deny it.”\r\n\r\n“Then prithee, how was it known?”\r\n\r\n“Certain witness did see them wending thither, good your Majesty; this\r\nbred the suspicion, and dire effects have since confirmed and justified\r\nit.  In particular, it is in evidence that through the wicked power so\r\nobtained, they did invoke and bring about a storm that wasted all the\r\nregion round about.  Above forty witnesses have proved the storm; and\r\nsooth one might have had a thousand, for all had reason to remember it,\r\nsith all had suffered by it.”\r\n\r\n“Certes this is a serious matter.”  Tom turned this dark piece of\r\nscoundrelism over in his mind a while, then asked--\r\n\r\n“Suffered the woman also by the storm?”\r\n\r\nSeveral old heads among the assemblage nodded their recognition of\r\nthe wisdom of this question.  The sheriff, however, saw nothing\r\nconsequential in the inquiry; he answered, with simple directness--\r\n\r\n“Indeed did she, your Majesty, and most righteously, as all aver. Her\r\nhabitation was swept away, and herself and child left shelterless.”\r\n\r\n“Methinks the power to do herself so ill a turn was dearly bought. She\r\nhad been cheated, had she paid but a farthing for it; that she paid\r\nher soul, and her child’s, argueth that she is mad; if she is mad she\r\nknoweth not what she doth, therefore sinneth not.”\r\n\r\nThe elderly heads nodded recognition of Tom’s wisdom once more, and one\r\nindividual murmured, “An’ the King be mad himself, according to report,\r\nthen is it a madness of a sort that would improve the sanity of some I\r\nwot of, if by the gentle providence of God they could but catch it.”\r\n\r\n“What age hath the child?” asked Tom.\r\n\r\n“Nine years, please your Majesty.”\r\n\r\n“By the law of England may a child enter into covenant and sell itself,\r\nmy lord?” asked Tom, turning to a learned judge.\r\n\r\n“The law doth not permit a child to make or meddle in any weighty\r\nmatter, good my liege, holding that its callow wit unfitteth it to cope\r\nwith the riper wit and evil schemings of them that are its elders.  The\r\n_Devil_ may buy a child, if he so choose, and the child agree thereto,\r\nbut not an Englishman--in this latter case the contract would be null\r\nand void.”\r\n\r\n“It seemeth a rude unchristian thing, and ill contrived, that English\r\nlaw denieth privileges to Englishmen to waste them on the devil!” cried\r\nTom, with honest heat.\r\n\r\nThis novel view of the matter excited many smiles, and was stored\r\naway in many heads to be repeated about the Court as evidence of Tom’s\r\noriginality as well as progress toward mental health.\r\n\r\nThe elder culprit had ceased from sobbing, and was hanging upon Tom’s\r\nwords with an excited interest and a growing hope.  Tom noticed this,\r\nand it strongly inclined his sympathies toward her in her perilous and\r\nunfriended situation.  Presently he asked--\r\n\r\n“How wrought they to bring the storm?”\r\n\r\n“_By pulling off their stockings_, sire.”\r\n\r\nThis astonished Tom, and also fired his curiosity to fever heat. He\r\nsaid, eagerly--\r\n\r\n“It is wonderful!  Hath it always this dread effect?”\r\n\r\n“Always, my liege--at least if the woman desire it, and utter the\r\nneedful words, either in her mind or with her tongue.”\r\n\r\nTom turned to the woman, and said with impetuous zeal--\r\n\r\n“Exert thy power--I would see a storm!”\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden paling of cheeks in the superstitious assemblage, and\r\na general, though unexpressed, desire to get out of the place--all of\r\nwhich was lost upon Tom, who was dead to everything but the proposed\r\ncataclysm.  Seeing a puzzled and astonished look in the woman’s face, he\r\nadded, excitedly--\r\n\r\n“Never fear--thou shalt be blameless.  More--thou shalt go free--none\r\nshall touch thee.  Exert thy power.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, my lord the King, I have it not--I have been falsely accused.”\r\n\r\n“Thy fears stay thee.  Be of good heart, thou shalt suffer no harm.\r\n Make a storm--it mattereth not how small a one--I require nought great\r\nor harmful, but indeed prefer the opposite--do this and thy life is\r\nspared--thou shalt go out free, with thy child, bearing the King’s\r\npardon, and safe from hurt or malice from any in the realm.”\r\n\r\nThe woman prostrated herself, and protested, with tears, that she had\r\nno power to do the miracle, else she would gladly win her child’s life\r\nalone, and be content to lose her own, if by obedience to the King’s\r\ncommand so precious a grace might be acquired.\r\n\r\nTom urged--the woman still adhered to her declarations.  Finally he\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n“I think the woman hath said true.  An’ _my_ mother were in her place\r\nand gifted with the devil’s functions, she had not stayed a moment to\r\ncall her storms and lay the whole land in ruins, if the saving of my\r\nforfeit life were the price she got!  It is argument that other\r\nmothers are made in like mould.  Thou art free, goodwife--thou and thy\r\nchild--for I do think thee innocent.  _Now_ thou’st nought to fear,\r\nbeing pardoned--pull off thy stockings!--an’ thou canst make me a storm,\r\nthou shalt be rich!”\r\n\r\nThe redeemed creature was loud in her gratitude, and proceeded to\r\nobey, whilst Tom looked on with eager expectancy, a little marred\r\nby apprehension; the courtiers at the same time manifesting decided\r\ndiscomfort and uneasiness.  The woman stripped her own feet and her\r\nlittle girl’s also, and plainly did her best to reward the King’s\r\ngenerosity with an earthquake, but it was all a failure and a\r\ndisappointment.  Tom sighed, and said--\r\n\r\n“There, good soul, trouble thyself no further, thy power is departed\r\nout of thee.  Go thy way in peace; and if it return to thee at any time,\r\nforget me not, but fetch me a storm.” {13}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI. The State Dinner.\r\n\r\nThe dinner hour drew near--yet strangely enough, the thought brought\r\nbut slight discomfort to Tom, and hardly any terror.  The morning’s\r\nexperiences had wonderfully built up his confidence; the poor little\r\nash-cat was already more wonted to his strange garret, after four\r\ndays’ habit, than a mature person could have become in a full month.  A\r\nchild’s facility in accommodating itself to circumstances was never more\r\nstrikingly illustrated.\r\n\r\nLet us privileged ones hurry to the great banqueting-room and have a\r\nglance at matters there whilst Tom is being made ready for the\r\nimposing occasion.  It is a spacious apartment, with gilded pillars\r\nand pilasters, and pictured walls and ceilings.  At the door stand tall\r\nguards, as rigid as statues, dressed in rich and picturesque costumes,\r\nand bearing halberds.  In a high gallery which runs all around the place\r\nis a band of musicians and a packed company of citizens of both sexes,\r\nin brilliant attire.  In the centre of the room, upon a raised platform,\r\nis Tom’s table. Now let the ancient chronicler speak:\r\n\r\n“A gentleman enters the room bearing a rod, and along with him another\r\nbearing a tablecloth, which, after they have both kneeled three times\r\nwith the utmost veneration, he spreads upon the table, and after\r\nkneeling again they both retire; then come two others, one with the rod\r\nagain, the other with a salt-cellar, a plate, and bread; when they have\r\nkneeled as the others had done, and placed what was brought upon the\r\ntable, they too retire with the same ceremonies performed by the first;\r\nat last come two nobles, richly clothed, one bearing a tasting-knife,\r\nwho, after prostrating themselves three times in the most graceful\r\nmanner, approach and rub the table with bread and salt, with as much awe\r\nas if the King had been present.” {6}\r\n\r\nSo end the solemn preliminaries.  Now, far down the echoing corridors\r\nwe hear a bugle-blast, and the indistinct cry, “Place for the King!\r\n Way for the King’s most excellent majesty!”  These sounds are momently\r\nrepeated--they grow nearer and nearer--and presently, almost in our\r\nfaces, the martial note peals and the cry rings out, “Way for the King!”\r\n  At this instant the shining pageant appears, and files in at the door,\r\nwith a measured march. Let the chronicler speak again:--\r\n\r\n“First come Gentlemen, Barons, Earls, Knights of the Garter, all richly\r\ndressed and bareheaded; next comes the Chancellor, between two, one of\r\nwhich carries the royal sceptre, the other the Sword of State in a red\r\nscabbard, studded with golden fleurs-de-lis, the point upwards; next\r\ncomes the King himself--whom, upon his appearing, twelve trumpets and\r\nmany drums salute with a great burst of welcome, whilst all in the\r\ngalleries rise in their places, crying ‘God save the King!’  After him\r\ncome nobles attached to his person, and on his right and left march his\r\nguard of honour, his fifty Gentlemen Pensioners, with gilt battle-axes.”\r\n\r\nThis was all fine and pleasant.  Tom’s pulse beat high, and a glad light\r\nwas in his eye.  He bore himself right gracefully, and all the more\r\nso because he was not thinking of how he was doing it, his mind being\r\ncharmed and occupied with the blithe sights and sounds about him--and\r\nbesides, nobody can be very ungraceful in nicely-fitting beautiful\r\nclothes after he has grown a little used to them--especially if he is\r\nfor the moment unconscious of them. Tom remembered his instructions, and\r\nacknowledged his greeting with a slight inclination of his plumed head,\r\nand a courteous “I thank ye, my good people.”\r\n\r\nHe seated himself at table, without removing his cap; and did it without\r\nthe least embarrassment; for to eat with one’s cap on was the one\r\nsolitary royal custom upon which the kings and the Cantys met upon\r\ncommon ground, neither party having any advantage over the other in the\r\nmatter of old familiarity with it.  The pageant broke up and grouped\r\nitself picturesquely, and remained bareheaded.\r\n\r\nNow to the sound of gay music the Yeomen of the Guard entered,--“the\r\ntallest and mightiest men in England, they being carefully selected in\r\nthis regard”--but we will let the chronicler tell about it:--\r\n\r\n“The Yeomen of the Guard entered, bareheaded, clothed in scarlet, with\r\ngolden roses upon their backs; and these went and came, bringing in each\r\nturn a course of dishes, served in plate.  These dishes were received\r\nby a gentleman in the same order they were brought, and placed upon\r\nthe table, while the taster gave to each guard a mouthful to eat of the\r\nparticular dish he had brought, for fear of any poison.”\r\n\r\nTom made a good dinner, notwithstanding he was conscious that hundreds\r\nof eyes followed each morsel to his mouth and watched him eat it with an\r\ninterest which could not have been more intense if it had been a deadly\r\nexplosive and was expected to blow him up and scatter him all about\r\nthe place.  He was careful not to hurry, and equally careful not to do\r\nanything whatever for himself, but wait till the proper official knelt\r\ndown and did it for him.  He got through without a mistake--flawless and\r\nprecious triumph.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was over at last and he marched away in the midst of his\r\nbright pageant, with the happy noises in his ears of blaring bugles,\r\nrolling drums, and thundering acclamations, he felt that if he had seen\r\nthe worst of dining in public it was an ordeal which he would be glad\r\nto endure several times a day if by that means he could but buy himself\r\nfree from some of the more formidable requirements of his royal office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII. Foo-foo the First.\r\n\r\nMiles Hendon hurried along toward the Southwark end of the bridge,\r\nkeeping a sharp look-out for the persons he sought, and hoping and\r\nexpecting to overtake them presently.  He was disappointed in this,\r\nhowever.  By asking questions, he was enabled to track them part of the\r\nway through Southwark; then all traces ceased, and he was perplexed as\r\nto how to proceed.  Still, he continued his efforts as best he\r\ncould during the rest of the day.  Nightfall found him leg-weary,\r\nhalf-famished, and his desire as far from accomplishment as ever; so\r\nhe supped at the Tabard Inn and went to bed, resolved to make an early\r\nstart in the morning, and give the town an exhaustive search.  As he lay\r\nthinking and planning, he presently began to reason thus:  The boy would\r\nescape from the ruffian, his reputed father, if possible; would he go\r\nback to London and seek his former haunts?  No, he would not do that,\r\nhe would avoid recapture. What, then, would he do?  Never having had a\r\nfriend in the world, or a protector, until he met Miles Hendon, he would\r\nnaturally try to find that friend again, provided the effort did not\r\nrequire him to go toward London and danger.  He would strike for Hendon\r\nHall, that is what he would do, for he knew Hendon was homeward bound\r\nand there he might expect to find him.  Yes, the case was plain to\r\nHendon--he must lose no more time in Southwark, but move at once through\r\nKent, toward Monk’s Holm, searching the wood and inquiring as he went.\r\n Let us return to the vanished little King now.\r\n\r\nThe ruffian whom the waiter at the inn on the bridge saw ‘about to join’\r\nthe youth and the King did not exactly join them, but fell in close\r\nbehind them and followed their steps.  He said nothing. His left arm was\r\nin a sling, and he wore a large green patch over his left eye; he limped\r\nslightly, and used an oaken staff as a support.  The youth led the King\r\na crooked course through Southwark, and by-and-by struck into the\r\nhigh road beyond.  The King was irritated, now, and said he would stop\r\nhere--it was Hendon’s place to come to him, not his to go to Hendon.  He\r\nwould not endure such insolence; he would stop where he was.  The youth\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n“Thou’lt tarry here, and thy friend lying wounded in the wood yonder?\r\n So be it, then.”\r\n\r\nThe King’s manner changed at once.  He cried out--\r\n\r\n“Wounded?  And who hath dared to do it?  But that is apart; lead on,\r\nlead on!  Faster, sirrah!  Art shod with lead?  Wounded, is he?  Now\r\nthough the doer of it be a duke’s son he shall rue it!”\r\n\r\nIt was some distance to the wood, but the space was speedily traversed.\r\nThe youth looked about him, discovered a bough sticking in the ground,\r\nwith a small bit of rag tied to it, then led the way into the forest,\r\nwatching for similar boughs and finding them at intervals; they were\r\nevidently guides to the point he was aiming at.  By-and-by an open place\r\nwas reached, where were the charred remains of a farm-house, and near\r\nthem a barn which was falling to ruin and decay.  There was no sign of\r\nlife anywhere, and utter silence prevailed.  The youth entered the barn,\r\nthe King following eagerly upon his heels.  No one there! The King shot\r\na surprised and suspicious glance at the youth, and asked--\r\n\r\n“Where is he?”\r\n\r\nA mocking laugh was his answer.  The King was in a rage in a moment; he\r\nseized a billet of wood and was in the act of charging upon the youth\r\nwhen another mocking laugh fell upon his ear.  It was from the lame\r\nruffian who had been following at a distance. The King turned and said\r\nangrily--\r\n\r\n“Who art thou?  What is thy business here?”\r\n\r\n“Leave thy foolery,” said the man, “and quiet thyself.  My disguise is\r\nnone so good that thou canst pretend thou knowest not thy father through\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Thou art not my father.  I know thee not.  I am the King.  If thou hast\r\nhid my servant, find him for me, or thou shalt sup sorrow for what thou\r\nhast done.”\r\n\r\nJohn Canty replied, in a stern and measured voice--\r\n\r\n“It is plain thou art mad, and I am loath to punish thee;  but if thou\r\nprovoke me, I must.  Thy prating doth no harm here, where there are\r\nno ears that need to mind thy follies; yet it is well to practise thy\r\ntongue to wary speech, that it may do no hurt when our quarters change.\r\n I have done a murder, and may not tarry at home--neither shalt thou,\r\nseeing I need thy service.  My name is changed, for wise reasons; it is\r\nHobbs--John Hobbs; thine is Jack--charge thy memory accordingly.  Now,\r\nthen, speak.  Where is thy mother?  Where are thy sisters?  They came\r\nnot to the place appointed--knowest thou whither they went?”\r\n\r\nThe King answered sullenly--\r\n\r\n“Trouble me not with these riddles.  My mother is dead; my sisters are\r\nin the palace.”\r\n\r\nThe youth near by burst into a derisive laugh, and the King would have\r\nassaulted him, but Canty--or Hobbs, as he now called himself--prevented\r\nhim, and said--\r\n\r\n“Peace, Hugo, vex him not; his mind is astray, and thy ways fret him.\r\nSit thee down, Jack, and quiet thyself; thou shalt have a morsel to eat,\r\nanon.”\r\n\r\nHobbs and Hugo fell to talking together, in low voices, and the King\r\nremoved himself as far as he could from their disagreeable company.\r\n He withdrew into the twilight of the farther end of the barn, where\r\nhe found the earthen floor bedded a foot deep with straw.  He lay down\r\nhere, drew straw over himself in lieu of blankets, and was soon absorbed\r\nin thinking.  He had many griefs, but the minor ones were swept almost\r\ninto forgetfulness by the supreme one, the loss of his father.  To\r\nthe rest of the world the name of Henry VIII. brought a shiver, and\r\nsuggested an ogre whose nostrils breathed destruction and whose hand\r\ndealt scourgings and death; but to this boy the name brought only\r\nsensations of pleasure; the figure it invoked wore a countenance that\r\nwas all gentleness and affection.  He called to mind a long succession\r\nof loving passages between his father and himself, and dwelt fondly upon\r\nthem, his unstinted tears attesting how deep and real was the grief that\r\npossessed his heart. As the afternoon wasted away, the lad, wearied with\r\nhis troubles, sank gradually into a tranquil and healing slumber.\r\n\r\nAfter a considerable time--he could not tell how long--his senses\r\nstruggled to a half-consciousness, and as he lay with closed eyes\r\nvaguely wondering where he was and what had been happening, he noted a\r\nmurmurous sound, the sullen beating of rain upon the roof. A snug sense\r\nof comfort stole over him, which was rudely broken, the next moment,\r\nby a chorus of piping cackles and coarse laughter.  It startled him\r\ndisagreeably, and he unmuffled his head to see whence this interruption\r\nproceeded.  A grim and unsightly picture met his eye.  A bright fire was\r\nburning in the middle of the floor, at the other end of the barn; and\r\naround it, and lit weirdly up by the red glare, lolled and sprawled the\r\nmotliest company of tattered gutter-scum and ruffians, of both sexes, he\r\nhad ever read or dreamed of.  There were huge stalwart men, brown\r\nwith exposure, long-haired, and clothed in fantastic rags; there were\r\nmiddle-sized youths, of truculent countenance, and similarly clad; there\r\nwere blind mendicants, with patched or bandaged eyes; crippled ones,\r\nwith wooden legs and crutches; diseased ones, with running sores peeping\r\nfrom ineffectual wrappings; there was a villain-looking pedlar with\r\nhis pack; a knife-grinder, a tinker, and a barber-surgeon, with the\r\nimplements of their trades; some of the females were hardly-grown girls,\r\nsome were at prime, some were old and wrinkled hags, and all were loud,\r\nbrazen, foul-mouthed; and all soiled and slatternly; there were three\r\nsore-faced babies; there were a couple of starveling curs, with strings\r\nabout their necks, whose office was to lead the blind.\r\n\r\nThe night was come, the gang had just finished feasting, an orgy was\r\nbeginning; the can of liquor was passing from mouth to mouth. A general\r\ncry broke forth--\r\n\r\n“A song! a song from the Bat and Dick and Dot-and-go-One!”\r\n\r\nOne of the blind men got up, and made ready by casting aside the patches\r\nthat sheltered his excellent eyes, and the pathetic placard which\r\nrecited the cause of his calamity.  Dot-and-go-One disencumbered himself\r\nof his timber leg and took his place, upon sound and healthy limbs,\r\nbeside his fellow-rascal; then they roared out a rollicking ditty,\r\nand were reinforced by the whole crew, at the end of each stanza, in\r\na rousing chorus.  By the time the last stanza was reached, the\r\nhalf-drunken enthusiasm had risen to such a pitch, that everybody joined\r\nin and sang it clear through from the beginning, producing a volume of\r\nvillainous sound that made the rafters quake.  These were the inspiring\r\nwords:--\r\n\r\n‘Bien Darkman’s then, Bouse Mort and Ken, The bien Coves bings awast, On\r\nChates to trine by Rome Coves dine For his long lib at last. Bing’d out\r\nbien Morts and toure, and toure, Bing out of the Rome vile bine, And\r\ntoure the Cove that cloy’d your duds, Upon the Chates to trine.’\r\n\r\n(From’The English Rogue.’ London, 1665.)\r\n\r\nConversation followed; not in the thieves’ dialect of the song, for that\r\nwas only used in talk when unfriendly ears might be listening.  In the\r\ncourse of it, it appeared that ‘John Hobbs’ was not altogether a new\r\nrecruit, but had trained in the gang at some former time.  His later\r\nhistory was called for, and when he said he had ‘accidentally’ killed a\r\nman, considerable satisfaction was expressed; when he added that the\r\nman was a priest, he was roundly applauded, and had to take a drink with\r\neverybody.  Old acquaintances welcomed him joyously, and new ones were\r\nproud to shake him by the hand.  He was asked why he had ’tarried away\r\nso many months.’  He answered--\r\n\r\n“London is better than the country, and safer, these late years, the\r\nlaws be so bitter and so diligently enforced.  An’ I had not had that\r\naccident, I had stayed there.  I had resolved to stay, and never more\r\nventure country-wards--but the accident has ended that.”\r\n\r\nHe inquired how many persons the gang numbered now.  The ‘ruffler,’ or\r\nchief, answered--\r\n\r\n“Five and twenty sturdy budges, bulks, files, clapperdogeons and\r\nmaunders, counting the dells and doxies and other morts. {7}  Most are\r\nhere, the rest are wandering eastward, along the winter lay. We follow\r\nat dawn.”\r\n\r\n“I do not see the Wen among the honest folk about me.  Where may he be?”\r\n\r\n“Poor lad, his diet is brimstone, now, and over hot for a delicate\r\ntaste. He was killed in a brawl, somewhere about midsummer.”\r\n\r\n“I sorrow to hear that; the Wen was a capable man, and brave.”\r\n\r\n“That was he, truly.  Black Bess, his dell, is of us yet, but absent on\r\nthe eastward tramp; a fine lass, of nice ways and orderly conduct, none\r\never seeing her drunk above four days in the seven.”\r\n\r\n“She was ever strict--I remember it well--a goodly wench and worthy\r\nall commendation.  Her mother was more free and less particular; a\r\ntroublesome and ugly-tempered beldame, but furnished with a wit above\r\nthe common.”\r\n\r\n“We lost her through it.  Her gift of palmistry and other sorts of\r\nfortune-telling begot for her at last a witch’s name and fame. The\r\nlaw roasted her to death at a slow fire.  It did touch me to a sort of\r\ntenderness to see the gallant way she met her lot--cursing and reviling\r\nall the crowd that gaped and gazed around her, whilst the flames licked\r\nupward toward her face and catched her thin locks and crackled about\r\nher old gray head--cursing them! why an’ thou should’st live a thousand\r\nyears thoud’st never hear so masterful a cursing.  Alack, her art died\r\nwith her.  There be base and weakling imitations left, but no true\r\nblasphemy.”\r\n\r\nThe Ruffler sighed; the listeners sighed in sympathy; a general\r\ndepression fell upon the company for a moment, for even hardened\r\noutcasts like these are not wholly dead to sentiment, but are able to\r\nfeel a fleeting sense of loss and affliction at wide intervals and\r\nunder peculiarly favouring circumstances--as in cases like to this, for\r\ninstance, when genius and culture depart and leave no heir.  However, a\r\ndeep drink all round soon restored the spirits of the mourners.\r\n\r\n“Have any others of our friends fared hardly?” asked Hobbs.\r\n\r\n“Some--yes.  Particularly new comers--such as small husbandmen turned\r\nshiftless and hungry upon the world because their farms were taken from\r\nthem to be changed to sheep ranges.  They begged, and were whipped at\r\nthe cart’s tail, naked from the girdle up, till the blood ran; then set\r\nin the stocks to be pelted; they begged again, were whipped again, and\r\ndeprived of an ear; they begged a third time--poor devils, what else\r\ncould they do?--and were branded on the cheek with a red-hot iron, then\r\nsold for slaves; they ran away, were hunted down, and hanged.  ‘Tis\r\na brief tale, and quickly told.  Others of us have fared less hardly.\r\nStand forth, Yokel, Burns, and Hodge--show your adornments!”\r\n\r\nThese stood up and stripped away some of their rags, exposing their\r\nbacks, criss-crossed with ropy old welts left by the lash; one turned\r\nup his hair and showed the place where a left ear had once been; another\r\nshowed a brand upon his shoulder--the letter V--and a mutilated ear; the\r\nthird said--\r\n\r\n“I am Yokel, once a farmer and prosperous, with loving wife and\r\nkids--now am I somewhat different in estate and calling; and the wife\r\nand kids are gone; mayhap they are in heaven, mayhap in--in the other\r\nplace--but the kindly God be thanked, they bide no more in _England_!\r\n My good old blameless mother strove to earn bread by nursing the sick;\r\none of these died, the doctors knew not how, so my mother was burnt for\r\na witch, whilst my babes looked on and wailed.  English law!--up,\r\nall, with your cups!--now all together and with a cheer!--drink to the\r\nmerciful English law that delivered _her_ from the English hell!  Thank\r\nyou, mates, one and all.  I begged, from house to house--I and the\r\nwife--bearing with us the hungry kids--but it was crime to be hungry in\r\nEngland--so they stripped us and lashed us through three towns.  Drink\r\nye all again to the merciful English law!--for its lash drank deep of my\r\nMary’s blood and its blessed deliverance came quick.  She lies there, in\r\nthe potter’s field, safe from all harms.  And the kids--well, whilst\r\nthe law lashed me from town to town, they starved. Drink, lads--only\r\na drop--a drop to the poor kids, that never did any creature harm.\r\n I begged again--begged, for a crust, and got the stocks and lost an\r\near--see, here bides the stump; I begged again, and here is the stump\r\nof the other to keep me minded of it. And still I begged again, and was\r\nsold for a slave--here on my cheek under this stain, if I washed it off,\r\nye might see the red S the branding-iron left there!  A _slave_!  Do\r\nyou understand that word?  An English _slave_!--that is he that stands\r\nbefore ye.  I have run from my master, and when I am found--the heavy\r\ncurse of heaven fall on the law of the land that hath commanded it!--I\r\nshall hang!” {1}\r\n\r\nA ringing voice came through the murky air--\r\n\r\n“Thou shalt _not_!--and this day the end of that law is come!”\r\n\r\nAll turned, and saw the fantastic figure of the little King approaching\r\nhurriedly; as it emerged into the light and was clearly revealed, a\r\ngeneral explosion of inquiries broke out--\r\n\r\n“Who is it?  _What_ is it?  Who art thou, manikin?”\r\n\r\nThe boy stood unconfused in the midst of all those surprised and\r\nquestioning eyes, and answered with princely dignity--\r\n\r\n“I am Edward, King of England.”\r\n\r\nA wild burst of laughter followed, partly of derision and partly of\r\ndelight in the excellence of the joke.  The King was stung.  He said\r\nsharply--\r\n\r\n“Ye mannerless vagrants, is this your recognition of the royal boon I\r\nhave promised?”\r\n\r\nHe said more, with angry voice and excited gesture, but it was lost in\r\na whirlwind of laughter and mocking exclamations.  ‘John Hobbs’ made\r\nseveral attempts to make himself heard above the din, and at last\r\nsucceeded--saying--\r\n\r\n“Mates, he is my son, a dreamer, a fool, and stark mad--mind him not--he\r\nthinketh he _is_ the King.”\r\n\r\n“I _am_ the King,” said Edward, turning toward him, “as thou shalt know\r\nto thy cost, in good time.  Thou hast confessed a murder--thou shalt\r\nswing for it.”\r\n\r\n“_Thou’lt_ betray me?--_thou_?  An’ I get my hands upon thee--”\r\n\r\n“Tut-tut!” said the burley Ruffler, interposing in time to save the\r\nKing, and emphasising this service by knocking Hobbs down with his fist,\r\n“hast respect for neither Kings _nor_ Rufflers?  An’ thou insult my\r\npresence so again, I’ll hang thee up myself.”  Then he said to his\r\nMajesty, “Thou must make no threats against thy mates, lad; and thou\r\nmust guard thy tongue from saying evil of them elsewhere.  _Be king_, if\r\nit please thy mad humour, but be not harmful in it.  Sink the title thou\r\nhast uttered--‘tis treason; we be bad men in some few trifling ways, but\r\nnone among us is so base as to be traitor to his King; we be loving\r\nand loyal hearts, in that regard.  Note if I speak truth.  Now--all\r\ntogether:  ‘Long live Edward, King of England!’”\r\n\r\n“LONG LIVE EDWARD, KING OF ENGLAND!”\r\n\r\nThe response came with such a thundergust from the motley crew that the\r\ncrazy building vibrated to the sound.  The little King’s face lighted\r\nwith pleasure for an instant, and he slightly inclined his head, and\r\nsaid with grave simplicity--\r\n\r\n“I thank you, my good people.”\r\n\r\nThis unexpected result threw the company into convulsions of merriment.\r\nWhen something like quiet was presently come again, the Ruffler said,\r\nfirmly, but with an accent of good nature--\r\n\r\n“Drop it, boy, ’tis not wise, nor well.  Humour thy fancy, if thou must,\r\nbut choose some other title.”\r\n\r\nA tinker shrieked out a suggestion--\r\n\r\n“Foo-foo the First, King of the Mooncalves!”\r\n\r\nThe title ’took,’ at once, every throat responded, and a roaring shout\r\nwent up, of--\r\n\r\n“Long live Foo-foo the First, King of the Mooncalves!” followed by\r\nhootings, cat-calls, and peals of laughter.\r\n\r\n“Hale him forth, and crown him!”\r\n\r\n“Robe him!”\r\n\r\n“Sceptre him!”\r\n\r\n“Throne him!”\r\n\r\nThese and twenty other cries broke out at once! and almost before the\r\npoor little victim could draw a breath he was crowned with a tin basin,\r\nrobed in a tattered blanket, throned upon a barrel, and sceptred with\r\nthe tinker’s soldering-iron.  Then all flung themselves upon their\r\nknees about him and sent up a chorus of ironical wailings, and mocking\r\nsupplications, whilst they swabbed their eyes with their soiled and\r\nragged sleeves and aprons--\r\n\r\n“Be gracious to us, O sweet King!”\r\n\r\n“Trample not upon thy beseeching worms, O noble Majesty!”\r\n\r\n“Pity thy slaves, and comfort them with a royal kick!”\r\n\r\n“Cheer us and warm us with thy gracious rays, O flaming sun of\r\nsovereignty!”\r\n\r\n“Sanctify the ground with the touch of thy foot, that we may eat the\r\ndirt and be ennobled!”\r\n\r\n“Deign to spit upon us, O Sire, that our children’s children may tell of\r\nthy princely condescension, and be proud and happy for ever!”\r\n\r\nBut the humorous tinker made the ‘hit’ of the evening and carried off\r\nthe honours.  Kneeling, he pretended to kiss the King’s foot, and was\r\nindignantly spurned; whereupon he went about begging for a rag to paste\r\nover the place upon his face which had been touched by the foot, saying\r\nit must be preserved from contact with the vulgar air, and that he\r\nshould make his fortune by going on the highway and exposing it to\r\nview at the rate of a hundred shillings a sight.  He made himself so\r\nkillingly funny that he was the envy and admiration of the whole mangy\r\nrabble.\r\n\r\nTears of shame and indignation stood in the little monarch’s eyes; and\r\nthe thought in his heart was, “Had I offered them a deep wrong they\r\ncould not be more cruel--yet have I proffered nought but to do them a\r\nkindness--and it is thus they use me for it!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII. The Prince with the Tramps.\r\n\r\nThe troop of vagabonds turned out at early dawn, and set forward on\r\ntheir march.  There was a lowering sky overhead, sloppy ground under\r\nfoot, and a winter chill in the air.  All gaiety was gone from the\r\ncompany; some were sullen and silent, some were irritable and petulant,\r\nnone were gentle-humoured, all were thirsty.\r\n\r\nThe Ruffler put ‘Jack’ in Hugo’s charge, with some brief instructions,\r\nand commanded John Canty to keep away from him and let him alone; he\r\nalso warned Hugo not to be too rough with the lad.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the weather grew milder, and the clouds lifted somewhat.\r\nThe troop ceased to shiver, and their spirits began to improve.  They\r\ngrew more and more cheerful, and finally began to chaff each other and\r\ninsult passengers along the highway.  This showed that they were awaking\r\nto an appreciation of life and its joys once more.  The dread in which\r\ntheir sort was held was apparent in the fact that everybody gave them\r\nthe road, and took their ribald insolences meekly, without venturing\r\nto talk back. They snatched linen from the hedges, occasionally in full\r\nview of the owners, who made no protest, but only seemed grateful that\r\nthey did not take the hedges, too.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by they invaded a small farmhouse and made themselves at home\r\nwhile the trembling farmer and his people swept the larder clean to\r\nfurnish a breakfast for them.  They chucked the housewife and her\r\ndaughters under the chin whilst receiving the food from their hands, and\r\nmade coarse jests about them, accompanied with insulting epithets and\r\nbursts of horse-laughter.  They threw bones and vegetables at the farmer\r\nand his sons, kept them dodging all the time, and applauded uproariously\r\nwhen a good hit was made. They ended by buttering the head of one of\r\nthe daughters who resented some of their familiarities.  When they took\r\ntheir leave they threatened to come back and burn the house over the\r\nheads of the family if any report of their doings got to the ears of the\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nAbout noon, after a long and weary tramp, the gang came to a halt behind\r\na hedge on the outskirts of a considerable village.  An hour was allowed\r\nfor rest, then the crew scattered themselves abroad to enter the village\r\nat different points to ply their various trades--‘Jack’ was sent with\r\nHugo.  They wandered hither and thither for some time, Hugo watching\r\nfor opportunities to do a stroke of business, but finding none--so he\r\nfinally said--\r\n\r\n“I see nought to steal; it is a paltry place.  Wherefore we will beg.”\r\n\r\n“_We_, forsooth!  Follow thy trade--it befits thee.  But _I_ will not\r\nbeg.”\r\n\r\n“Thou’lt not beg!” exclaimed Hugo, eyeing the King with surprise.\r\n“Prithee, since when hast thou reformed?”\r\n\r\n“What dost thou mean?”\r\n\r\n“Mean?  Hast thou not begged the streets of London all thy life?”\r\n\r\n“I?  Thou idiot!”\r\n\r\n“Spare thy compliments--thy stock will last the longer.  Thy father says\r\nthou hast begged all thy days.  Mayhap he lied. Peradventure you will\r\neven make so bold as to _say_ he lied,” scoffed Hugo.\r\n\r\n“Him _you_ call my father?  Yes, he lied.”\r\n\r\n“Come, play not thy merry game of madman so far, mate; use it for thy\r\namusement, not thy hurt.  An’ I tell him this, he will scorch thee\r\nfinely for it.”\r\n\r\n“Save thyself the trouble.  I will tell him.”\r\n\r\n“I like thy spirit, I do in truth; but I do not admire thy judgment.\r\nBone-rackings and bastings be plenty enow in this life, without going\r\nout of one’s way to invite them.  But a truce to these matters; _I_\r\nbelieve your father.  I doubt not he can lie; I doubt not he _doth_\r\nlie, upon occasion, for the best of us do that; but there is no occasion\r\nhere.  A wise man does not waste so good a commodity as lying for\r\nnought.  But come; sith it is thy humour to give over begging,\r\nwherewithal shall we busy ourselves?  With robbing kitchens?”\r\n\r\nThe King said, impatiently--\r\n\r\n“Have done with this folly--you weary me!”\r\n\r\nHugo replied, with temper--\r\n\r\n“Now harkee, mate; you will not beg, you will not rob; so be it. But I\r\nwill tell you what you _will_ do.  You will play decoy whilst _I_ beg.\r\nRefuse, an’ you think you may venture!”\r\n\r\nThe King was about to reply contemptuously, when Hugo said,\r\ninterrupting--\r\n\r\n“Peace!  Here comes one with a kindly face.  Now will I fall down in\r\na fit.  When the stranger runs to me, set you up a wail, and fall upon\r\nyour knees, seeming to weep; then cry out as all the devils of misery\r\nwere in your belly, and say, ‘Oh, sir, it is my poor afflicted brother,\r\nand we be friendless; o’ God’s name cast through your merciful eyes one\r\npitiful look upon a sick, forsaken, and most miserable wretch; bestow\r\none little penny out of thy riches upon one smitten of God and ready\r\nto perish!’--and mind you, keep you _on_ wailing, and abate not till we\r\nbilk him of his penny, else shall you rue it.”\r\n\r\nThen immediately Hugo began to moan, and groan, and roll his eyes, and\r\nreel and totter about; and when the stranger was close at hand, down he\r\nsprawled before him, with a shriek, and began to writhe and wallow in\r\nthe dirt, in seeming agony.\r\n\r\n“O, dear, O dear!” cried the benevolent stranger, “O poor soul, poor\r\nsoul, how he doth suffer!  There--let me help thee up.”\r\n\r\n“O noble sir, forbear, and God love you for a princely gentleman--but it\r\ngiveth me cruel pain to touch me when I am taken so.  My brother there\r\nwill tell your worship how I am racked with anguish when these fits be\r\nupon me.  A penny, dear sir, a penny, to buy a little food; then leave\r\nme to my sorrows.”\r\n\r\n“A penny! thou shalt have three, thou hapless creature,”--and he fumbled\r\nin his pocket with nervous haste and got them out. “There, poor lad,\r\ntake them and most welcome.  Now come hither, my boy, and help me carry\r\nthy stricken brother to yon house, where--”\r\n\r\n“I am not his brother,” said the King, interrupting.\r\n\r\n“What! not his brother?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, hear him!” groaned Hugo, then privately ground his teeth. “He\r\ndenies his own brother--and he with one foot in the grave!”\r\n\r\n“Boy, thou art indeed hard of heart, if this is thy brother.  For\r\nshame!--and he scarce able to move hand or foot.  If he is not thy\r\nbrother, who is he, then?”\r\n\r\n“A beggar and a thief!  He has got your money and has picked your pocket\r\nlikewise.  An’ thou would’st do a healing miracle, lay thy staff over\r\nhis shoulders and trust Providence for the rest.”\r\n\r\nBut Hugo did not tarry for the miracle.  In a moment he was up and off\r\nlike the wind, the gentleman following after and raising the hue and cry\r\nlustily as he went.  The King, breathing deep gratitude to Heaven for\r\nhis own release, fled in the opposite direction, and did not slacken\r\nhis pace until he was out of harm’s reach.  He took the first road that\r\noffered, and soon put the village behind him.  He hurried along, as\r\nbriskly as he could, during several hours, keeping a nervous watch over\r\nhis shoulder for pursuit; but his fears left him at last, and a grateful\r\nsense of security took their place.  He recognised, now, that he was\r\nhungry, and also very tired.  So he halted at a farmhouse; but when\r\nhe was about to speak, he was cut short and driven rudely away.  His\r\nclothes were against him.\r\n\r\nHe wandered on, wounded and indignant, and was resolved to put himself\r\nin the way of like treatment no more.  But hunger is pride’s master; so,\r\nas the evening drew near, he made an attempt at another farmhouse; but\r\nhere he fared worse than before; for he was called hard names and was\r\npromised arrest as a vagrant except he moved on promptly.\r\n\r\nThe night came on, chilly and overcast; and still the footsore monarch\r\nlaboured slowly on.  He was obliged to keep moving, for every time he\r\nsat down to rest he was soon penetrated to the bone with the cold.  All\r\nhis sensations and experiences, as he moved through the solemn gloom\r\nand the empty vastness of the night, were new and strange to him.  At\r\nintervals he heard voices approach, pass by, and fade into silence; and\r\nas he saw nothing more of the bodies they belonged to than a sort of\r\nformless drifting blur, there was something spectral and uncanny about\r\nit all that made him shudder.  Occasionally he caught the twinkle of a\r\nlight--always far away, apparently--almost in another world; if he heard\r\nthe tinkle of a sheep’s bell, it was vague, distant, indistinct;\r\nthe muffled lowing of the herds floated to him on the night wind in\r\nvanishing cadences, a mournful sound; now and then came the complaining\r\nhowl of a dog over viewless expanses of field and forest; all sounds\r\nwere remote; they made the little King feel that all life and activity\r\nwere far removed from him, and that he stood solitary, companionless, in\r\nthe centre of a measureless solitude.\r\n\r\nHe stumbled along, through the gruesome fascinations of this new\r\nexperience, startled occasionally by the soft rustling of the dry leaves\r\noverhead, so like human whispers they seemed to sound; and by-and-by he\r\ncame suddenly upon the freckled light of a tin lantern near at hand.  He\r\nstepped back into the shadows and waited.  The lantern stood by the\r\nopen door of a barn.  The King waited some time--there was no sound,\r\nand nobody stirring.  He got so cold, standing still, and the hospitable\r\nbarn looked so enticing, that at last he resolved to risk everything and\r\nenter. He started swiftly and stealthily, and just as he was crossing\r\nthe threshold he heard voices behind him.  He darted behind a cask,\r\nwithin the barn, and stooped down.  Two farm-labourers came in, bringing\r\nthe lantern with them, and fell to work, talking meanwhile.  Whilst they\r\nmoved about with the light, the King made good use of his eyes and took\r\nthe bearings of what seemed to be a good-sized stall at the further end\r\nof the place, purposing to grope his way to it when he should be left to\r\nhimself.  He also noted the position of a pile of horse blankets, midway\r\nof the route, with the intent to levy upon them for the service of the\r\ncrown of England for one night.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by the men finished and went away, fastening the door behind\r\nthem and taking the lantern with them.  The shivering King made for the\r\nblankets, with as good speed as the darkness would allow; gathered them\r\nup, and then groped his way safely to the stall.  Of two of the blankets\r\nhe made a bed, then covered himself with the remaining two.  He was a\r\nglad monarch, now, though the blankets were old and thin, and not quite\r\nwarm enough; and besides gave out a pungent horsey odour that was almost\r\nsuffocatingly powerful.\r\n\r\nAlthough the King was hungry and chilly, he was also so tired and so\r\ndrowsy that these latter influences soon began to get the advantage\r\nof the former, and he presently dozed off into a state of\r\nsemi-consciousness.  Then, just as he was on the point of losing himself\r\nwholly, he distinctly felt something touch him!  He was broad awake in\r\na moment, and gasping for breath.  The cold horror of that mysterious\r\ntouch in the dark almost made his heart stand still.  He lay motionless,\r\nand listened, scarcely breathing. But nothing stirred, and there was\r\nno sound.  He continued to listen, and wait, during what seemed a long\r\ntime, but still nothing stirred, and there was no sound.  So he began\r\nto drop into a drowse once more, at last; and all at once he felt that\r\nmysterious touch again!  It was a grisly thing, this light touch from\r\nthis noiseless and invisible presence; it made the boy sick with ghostly\r\nfears.  What should he do?  That was the question; but he did not know\r\nhow to answer it.  Should he leave these reasonably comfortable quarters\r\nand fly from this inscrutable horror?  But fly whither?  He could\r\nnot get out of the barn; and the idea of scurrying blindly hither and\r\nthither in the dark, within the captivity of the four walls, with this\r\nphantom gliding after him, and visiting him with that soft hideous touch\r\nupon cheek or shoulder at every turn, was intolerable.  But to stay\r\nwhere he was, and endure this living death all night--was that better?\r\n No.  What, then, was there left to do?  Ah, there was but one course;\r\nhe knew it well--he must put out his hand and find that thing!\r\n\r\nIt was easy to think this; but it was hard to brace himself up to try\r\nit. Three times he stretched his hand a little way out into the dark,\r\ngingerly; and snatched it suddenly back, with a gasp--not because it\r\nhad encountered anything, but because he had felt so sure it was just\r\n_going_ to.  But the fourth time, he groped a little further, and his\r\nhand lightly swept against something soft and warm.  This petrified him,\r\nnearly, with fright; his mind was in such a state that he could imagine\r\nthe thing to be nothing else than a corpse, newly dead and still warm.\r\nHe thought he would rather die than touch it again.  But he thought this\r\nfalse thought because he did not know the immortal strength of\r\nhuman curiosity. In no long time his hand was tremblingly groping\r\nagain--against his judgment, and without his consent--but groping\r\npersistently on, just the same.  It encountered a bunch of long hair; he\r\nshuddered, but followed up the hair and found what seemed to be a warm\r\nrope; followed up the rope and found an innocent calf!--for the rope was\r\nnot a rope at all, but the calf’s tail.\r\n\r\nThe King was cordially ashamed of himself for having gotten all that\r\nfright and misery out of so paltry a matter as a slumbering calf; but he\r\nneed not have felt so about it, for it was not the calf that frightened\r\nhim, but a dreadful non-existent something which the calf stood for; and\r\nany other boy, in those old superstitious times, would have acted and\r\nsuffered just as he had done.\r\n\r\nThe King was not only delighted to find that the creature was only a\r\ncalf, but delighted to have the calf’s company; for he had been feeling\r\nso lonesome and friendless that the company and comradeship of even\r\nthis humble animal were welcome.  And he had been so buffeted, so rudely\r\nentreated by his own kind, that it was a real comfort to him to feel\r\nthat he was at last in the society of a fellow-creature that had at\r\nleast a soft heart and a gentle spirit, whatever loftier attributes\r\nmight be lacking.  So he resolved to waive rank and make friends with\r\nthe calf.\r\n\r\nWhile stroking its sleek warm back--for it lay near him and within easy\r\nreach--it occurred to him that this calf might be utilised in more ways\r\nthan one.  Whereupon he re-arranged his bed, spreading it down close to\r\nthe calf; then he cuddled himself up to the calf’s back, drew the covers\r\nup over himself and his friend, and in a minute or two was as warm and\r\ncomfortable as he had ever been in the downy couches of the regal palace\r\nof Westminster.\r\n\r\nPleasant thoughts came at once; life took on a cheerfuller seeming.  He\r\nwas free of the bonds of servitude and crime, free of the companionship\r\nof base and brutal outlaws; he was warm; he was sheltered; in a word, he\r\nwas happy.  The night wind was rising; it swept by in fitful gusts\r\nthat made the old barn quake and rattle, then its forces died down\r\nat intervals, and went moaning and wailing around corners and\r\nprojections--but it was all music to the King, now that he was snug and\r\ncomfortable: let it blow and rage, let it batter and bang, let it moan\r\nand wail, he minded it not, he only enjoyed it.  He merely snuggled\r\nthe closer to his friend, in a luxury of warm contentment, and drifted\r\nblissfully out of consciousness into a deep and dreamless sleep that\r\nwas full of serenity and peace.  The distant dogs howled, the melancholy\r\nkine complained, and the winds went on raging, whilst furious sheets\r\nof rain drove along the roof; but the Majesty of England slept on,\r\nundisturbed, and the calf did the same, it being a simple creature, and\r\nnot easily troubled by storms or embarrassed by sleeping with a king.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX. The Prince with the peasants.\r\n\r\nWhen the King awoke in the early morning, he found that a wet but\r\nthoughtful rat had crept into the place during the night and made a cosy\r\nbed for itself in his bosom.  Being disturbed now, it scampered away.\r\nThe boy smiled, and said, “Poor fool, why so fearful?  I am as forlorn\r\nas thou.  ‘Twould be a sham in me to hurt the helpless, who am myself so\r\nhelpless.  Moreover, I owe you thanks for a good omen; for when a king\r\nhas fallen so low that the very rats do make a bed of him, it surely\r\nmeaneth that his fortunes be upon the turn, since it is plain he can no\r\nlower go.”\r\n\r\nHe got up and stepped out of the stall, and just then he heard the sound\r\nof children’s voices.  The barn door opened and a couple of little girls\r\ncame in.  As soon as they saw him their talking and laughing ceased, and\r\nthey stopped and stood still, gazing at him with strong curiosity; they\r\npresently began to whisper together, then they approached nearer, and\r\nstopped again to gaze and whisper.  By-and-by they gathered courage and\r\nbegan to discuss him aloud.  One said--\r\n\r\n“He hath a comely face.”\r\n\r\nThe other added--\r\n\r\n“And pretty hair.”\r\n\r\n“But is ill clothed enow.”\r\n\r\n“And how starved he looketh.”\r\n\r\nThey came still nearer, sidling shyly around and about him, examining\r\nhim minutely from all points, as if he were some strange new kind of\r\nanimal, but warily and watchfully the while, as if they half feared he\r\nmight be a sort of animal that would bite, upon occasion.  Finally they\r\nhalted before him, holding each other’s hands for protection, and took a\r\ngood satisfying stare with their innocent eyes; then one of them plucked\r\nup all her courage and inquired with honest directness--\r\n\r\n“Who art thou, boy?”\r\n\r\n“I am the King,” was the grave answer.\r\n\r\nThe children gave a little start, and their eyes spread themselves wide\r\nopen and remained so during a speechless half minute.  Then curiosity\r\nbroke the silence--\r\n\r\n“The _King_?  What King?”\r\n\r\n“The King of England.”\r\n\r\nThe children looked at each other--then at him--then at each other\r\nagain--wonderingly, perplexedly; then one said--\r\n\r\n“Didst hear him, Margery?--he said he is the King.  Can that be true?”\r\n\r\n“How can it be else but true, Prissy?  Would he say a lie?  For look\r\nyou, Prissy, an’ it were not true, it _would_ be a lie.  It surely would\r\nbe. Now think on’t.  For all things that be not true, be lies--thou\r\ncanst make nought else out of it.”\r\n\r\nIt was a good tight argument, without a leak in it anywhere; and it left\r\nPrissy’s half-doubts not a leg to stand on.  She considered a moment,\r\nthen put the King upon his honour with the simple remark--\r\n\r\n“If thou art truly the King, then I believe thee.”\r\n\r\n“I am truly the King.”\r\n\r\nThis settled the matter.  His Majesty’s royalty was accepted without\r\nfurther question or discussion, and the two little girls began at once\r\nto inquire into how he came to be where he was, and how he came to be so\r\nunroyally clad, and whither he was bound, and all about his affairs.  It\r\nwas a mighty relief to him to pour out his troubles where they would not\r\nbe scoffed at or doubted; so he told his tale with feeling, forgetting\r\neven his hunger for the time; and it was received with the deepest and\r\ntenderest sympathy by the gentle little maids.  But when he got down\r\nto his latest experiences and they learned how long he had been without\r\nfood, they cut him short and hurried him away to the farmhouse to find a\r\nbreakfast for him.\r\n\r\nThe King was cheerful and happy now, and said to himself, “When I\r\nam come to mine own again, I will always honour little children,\r\nremembering how that these trusted me and believed in me in my time\r\nof trouble; whilst they that were older, and thought themselves wiser,\r\nmocked at me and held me for a liar.”\r\n\r\nThe children’s mother received the King kindly, and was full of pity;\r\nfor his forlorn condition and apparently crazed intellect touched her\r\nwomanly heart.  She was a widow, and rather poor; consequently she had\r\nseen trouble enough to enable her to feel for the unfortunate.  She\r\nimagined that the demented boy had wandered away from his friends or\r\nkeepers; so she tried to find out whence he had come, in order that\r\nshe might take measures to return him; but all her references to\r\nneighbouring towns and villages, and all her inquiries in the same line\r\nwent for nothing--the boy’s face, and his answers, too, showed that the\r\nthings she was talking of were not familiar to him.  He spoke earnestly\r\nand simply about court matters, and broke down, more than once, when\r\nspeaking of the late King ‘his father’; but whenever the conversation\r\nchanged to baser topics, he lost interest and became silent.\r\n\r\nThe woman was mightily puzzled; but she did not give up.  As she\r\nproceeded with her cooking, she set herself to contriving devices to\r\nsurprise the boy into betraying his real secret.  She talked about\r\ncattle--he showed no concern; then about sheep--the same result:  so\r\nher guess that he had been a shepherd boy was an error; she talked about\r\nmills; and about weavers, tinkers, smiths, trades and tradesmen of all\r\nsorts; and about Bedlam, and jails, and charitable retreats:  but no\r\nmatter, she was baffled at all points.  Not altogether, either; for she\r\nargued that she had narrowed the thing down to domestic service.  Yes,\r\nshe was sure she was on the right track, now; he must have been a house\r\nservant.  So she led up to that.  But the result was discouraging. The\r\nsubject of sweeping appeared to weary him; fire-building failed to stir\r\nhim; scrubbing and scouring awoke no enthusiasm. The goodwife touched,\r\nwith a perishing hope, and rather as a matter of form, upon the subject\r\nof cooking.  To her surprise, and her vast delight, the King’s face\r\nlighted at once!  Ah, she had hunted him down at last, she thought; and\r\nshe was right proud, too, of the devious shrewdness and tact which had\r\naccomplished it.\r\n\r\nHer tired tongue got a chance to rest, now; for the King’s, inspired\r\nby gnawing hunger and the fragrant smells that came from the sputtering\r\npots and pans, turned itself loose and delivered itself up to such an\r\neloquent dissertation upon certain toothsome dishes, that within three\r\nminutes the woman said to herself, “Of a truth I was right--he hath\r\nholpen in a kitchen!”  Then he broadened his bill of fare, and discussed\r\nit with such appreciation and animation, that the goodwife said to\r\nherself, “Good lack! how can he know so many dishes, and so fine ones\r\nwithal?  For these belong only upon the tables of the rich and great.\r\n Ah, now I see! ragged outcast as he is, he must have served in the\r\npalace before his reason went astray; yes, he must have helped in the\r\nvery kitchen of the King himself!  I will test him.”\r\n\r\nFull of eagerness to prove her sagacity, she told the King to mind the\r\ncooking a moment--hinting that he might manufacture and add a dish or\r\ntwo, if he chose; then she went out of the room and gave her children a\r\nsign to follow after.  The King muttered--\r\n\r\n“Another English king had a commission like to this, in a bygone\r\ntime--it is nothing against my dignity to undertake an office which the\r\ngreat Alfred stooped to assume.  But I will try to better serve my trust\r\nthan he; for he let the cakes burn.”\r\n\r\nThe intent was good, but the performance was not answerable to it, for\r\nthis King, like the other one, soon fell into deep thinkings concerning\r\nhis vast affairs, and the same calamity resulted--the cookery got\r\nburned. The woman returned in time to save the breakfast from entire\r\ndestruction; and she promptly brought the King out of his dreams with a\r\nbrisk and cordial tongue-lashing. Then, seeing how troubled he was\r\nover his violated trust, she softened at once, and was all goodness and\r\ngentleness toward him.\r\n\r\nThe boy made a hearty and satisfying meal, and was greatly refreshed and\r\ngladdened by it.  It was a meal which was distinguished by this curious\r\nfeature, that rank was waived on both sides; yet neither recipient\r\nof the favour was aware that it had been extended.  The goodwife had\r\nintended to feed this young tramp with broken victuals in a corner,\r\nlike any other tramp or like a dog; but she was so remorseful for the\r\nscolding she had given him, that she did what she could to atone for it\r\nby allowing him to sit at the family table and eat with his betters, on\r\nostensible terms of equality with them; and the King, on his side, was\r\nso remorseful for having broken his trust, after the family had been so\r\nkind to him, that he forced himself to atone for it by humbling himself\r\nto the family level, instead of requiring the woman and her children to\r\nstand and wait upon him, while he occupied their table in the solitary\r\nstate due to his birth and dignity.  It does us all good to unbend\r\nsometimes.  This good woman was made happy all the day long by the\r\napplauses which she got out of herself for her magnanimous condescension\r\nto a tramp; and the King was just as self-complacent over his gracious\r\nhumility toward a humble peasant woman.\r\n\r\nWhen breakfast was over, the housewife told the King to wash up the\r\ndishes.  This command was a staggerer, for a moment, and the King came\r\nnear rebelling; but then he said to himself, “Alfred the Great watched\r\nthe cakes; doubtless he would have washed the dishes too--therefore will\r\nI essay it.”\r\n\r\nHe made a sufficiently poor job of it; and to his surprise too, for the\r\ncleaning of wooden spoons and trenchers had seemed an easy thing to do.\r\nIt was a tedious and troublesome piece of work, but he finished it\r\nat last.  He was becoming impatient to get away on his journey now;\r\nhowever, he was not to lose this thrifty dame’s society so easily.  She\r\nfurnished him some little odds and ends of employment, which he got\r\nthrough with after a fair fashion and with some credit.  Then she set\r\nhim and the little girls to paring some winter apples; but he was so\r\nawkward at this service that she retired him from it and gave him a\r\nbutcher knife to grind.\r\n\r\nAfterwards she kept him carding wool until he began to think he had laid\r\nthe good King Alfred about far enough in the shade for the present in\r\nthe matter of showy menial heroisms that would read picturesquely in\r\nstory-books and histories, and so he was half-minded to resign.  And\r\nwhen, just after the noonday dinner, the goodwife gave him a basket\r\nof kittens to drown, he did resign.  At least he was just going to\r\nresign--for he felt that he must draw the line somewhere, and it\r\nseemed to him that to draw it at kitten-drowning was about the right\r\nthing--when there was an interruption.  The interruption was John\r\nCanty--with a peddler’s pack on his back--and Hugo.\r\n\r\nThe King discovered these rascals approaching the front gate before they\r\nhad had a chance to see him; so he said nothing about drawing the line,\r\nbut took up his basket of kittens and stepped quietly out the back way,\r\nwithout a word.  He left the creatures in an out-house, and hurried on,\r\ninto a narrow lane at the rear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX. The Prince and the hermit.\r\n\r\nThe high hedge hid him from the house, now; and so, under the impulse of\r\na deadly fright, he let out all his forces and sped toward a wood in the\r\ndistance.  He never looked back until he had almost gained the shelter\r\nof the forest; then he turned and descried two figures in the distance.\r\nThat was sufficient; he did not wait to scan them critically, but\r\nhurried on, and never abated his pace till he was far within the\r\ntwilight depths of the wood. Then he stopped; being persuaded that he\r\nwas now tolerably safe. He listened intently, but the stillness was\r\nprofound and solemn--awful, even, and depressing to the spirits.  At\r\nwide intervals his straining ear did detect sounds, but they were so\r\nremote, and hollow, and mysterious, that they seemed not to be real\r\nsounds, but only the moaning and complaining ghosts of departed\r\nones.  So the sounds were yet more dreary than the silence which they\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\nIt was his purpose, in the beginning, to stay where he was the rest of\r\nthe day; but a chill soon invaded his perspiring body, and he was at\r\nlast obliged to resume movement in order to get warm. He struck straight\r\nthrough the forest, hoping to pierce to a road presently, but he was\r\ndisappointed in this.  He travelled on and on; but the farther he went,\r\nthe denser the wood became, apparently.  The gloom began to thicken,\r\nby-and-by, and the King realised that the night was coming on.  It made\r\nhim shudder to think of spending it in such an uncanny place; so he\r\ntried to hurry faster, but he only made the less speed, for he could\r\nnot now see well enough to choose his steps judiciously; consequently he\r\nkept tripping over roots and tangling himself in vines and briers.\r\n\r\nAnd how glad he was when at last he caught the glimmer of a light! He\r\napproached it warily, stopping often to look about him and listen.  It\r\ncame from an unglazed window-opening in a shabby little hut.  He heard\r\na voice, now, and felt a disposition to run and hide; but he changed his\r\nmind at once, for this voice was praying, evidently.  He glided to the\r\none window of the hut, raised himself on tiptoe, and stole a glance\r\nwithin.  The room was small; its floor was the natural earth, beaten\r\nhard by use; in a corner was a bed of rushes and a ragged blanket or\r\ntwo; near it was a pail, a cup, a basin, and two or three pots and pans;\r\nthere was a short bench and a three-legged stool; on the hearth the\r\nremains of a faggot fire were smouldering; before a shrine, which was\r\nlighted by a single candle, knelt an aged man, and on an old wooden box\r\nat his side lay an open book and a human skull.  The man was of large,\r\nbony frame; his hair and whiskers were very long and snowy white; he\r\nwas clothed in a robe of sheepskins which reached from his neck to his\r\nheels.\r\n\r\n“A holy hermit!” said the King to himself; “now am I indeed fortunate.”\r\n\r\nThe hermit rose from his knees; the King knocked.  A deep voice\r\nresponded--\r\n\r\n“Enter!--but leave sin behind, for the ground whereon thou shalt stand\r\nis holy!”\r\n\r\nThe King entered, and paused.  The hermit turned a pair of gleaming,\r\nunrestful eyes upon him, and said--\r\n\r\n“Who art thou?”\r\n\r\n“I am the King,” came the answer, with placid simplicity.\r\n\r\n“Welcome, King!” cried the hermit, with enthusiasm.  Then, bustling\r\nabout with feverish activity, and constantly saying, “Welcome, welcome,”\r\n he arranged his bench, seated the King on it, by the hearth, threw some\r\nfaggots on the fire, and finally fell to pacing the floor with a nervous\r\nstride.\r\n\r\n“Welcome!  Many have sought sanctuary here, but they were not worthy,\r\nand were turned away.  But a King who casts his crown away, and despises\r\nthe vain splendours of his office, and clothes his body in rags, to\r\ndevote his life to holiness and the mortification of the flesh--he is\r\nworthy, he is welcome!--here shall he abide all his days till death\r\ncome.”  The King hastened to interrupt and explain, but the hermit paid\r\nno attention to him--did not even hear him, apparently, but went right\r\non with his talk, with a raised voice and a growing energy.  “And thou\r\nshalt be at peace here.  None shall find out thy refuge to disquiet thee\r\nwith supplications to return to that empty and foolish life which God\r\nhath moved thee to abandon.  Thou shalt pray here; thou shalt study the\r\nBook; thou shalt meditate upon the follies and delusions of this world,\r\nand upon the sublimities of the world to come; thou shalt feed upon\r\ncrusts and herbs, and scourge thy body with whips, daily, to the\r\npurifying of thy soul. Thou shalt wear a hair shirt next thy skin;\r\nthou shalt drink water only; and thou shalt be at peace; yes, wholly at\r\npeace; for whoso comes to seek thee shall go his way again, baffled; he\r\nshall not find thee, he shall not molest thee.”\r\n\r\nThe old man, still pacing back and forth, ceased to speak aloud, and\r\nbegan to mutter.  The King seized this opportunity to state his case;\r\nand he did it with an eloquence inspired by uneasiness and apprehension.\r\n But the hermit went on muttering, and gave no heed.  And still\r\nmuttering, he approached the King and said impressively--\r\n\r\n“‘Sh!  I will tell you a secret!”  He bent down to impart it, but\r\nchecked himself, and assumed a listening attitude.  After a moment\r\nor two he went on tiptoe to the window-opening, put his head out, and\r\npeered around in the gloaming, then came tiptoeing back again, put his\r\nface close down to the King’s, and whispered--\r\n\r\n“I am an archangel!”\r\n\r\nThe King started violently, and said to himself, “Would God I were with\r\nthe outlaws again; for lo, now am I the prisoner of a madman!”  His\r\napprehensions were heightened, and they showed plainly in his face.  In\r\na low excited voice the hermit continued--\r\n\r\n“I see you feel my atmosphere!  There’s awe in your face!  None may\r\nbe in this atmosphere and not be thus affected; for it is the very\r\natmosphere of heaven.  I go thither and return, in the twinkling of an\r\neye.  I was made an archangel on this very spot, it is five years ago,\r\nby angels sent from heaven to confer that awful dignity.  Their presence\r\nfilled this place with an intolerable brightness.  And they knelt to me,\r\nKing! yes, they knelt to me! for I was greater than they.  I have walked\r\nin the courts of heaven, and held speech with the patriarchs.  Touch\r\nmy hand--be not afraid--touch it.  There--now thou hast touched a hand\r\nwhich has been clasped by Abraham and Isaac and Jacob!  For I have\r\nwalked in the golden courts; I have seen the Deity face to face!”  He\r\npaused, to give this speech effect; then his face suddenly changed, and\r\nhe started to his feet again saying, with angry energy, “Yes, I am an\r\narchangel; _a mere archangel!_--I that might have been pope!  It is\r\nverily true.  I was told it from heaven in a dream, twenty years ago;\r\nah, yes, I was to be pope!--and I _should_ have been pope, for Heaven\r\nhad said it--but the King dissolved my religious house, and I, poor\r\nobscure unfriended monk, was cast homeless upon the world, robbed of my\r\nmighty destiny!” Here he began to mumble again, and beat his forehead in\r\nfutile rage, with his fist; now and then articulating a venomous curse,\r\nand now and then a pathetic “Wherefore I am nought but an archangel--I\r\nthat should have been pope!”\r\n\r\nSo he went on, for an hour, whilst the poor little King sat and\r\nsuffered. Then all at once the old man’s frenzy departed, and he became\r\nall gentleness.  His voice softened, he came down out of his clouds, and\r\nfell to prattling along so simply and so humanly, that he soon won the\r\nKing’s heart completely.  The old devotee moved the boy nearer to the\r\nfire and made him comfortable; doctored his small bruises and abrasions\r\nwith a deft and tender hand; and then set about preparing and cooking a\r\nsupper--chatting pleasantly all the time, and occasionally stroking the\r\nlad’s cheek or patting his head, in such a gently caressing way that in\r\na little while all the fear and repulsion inspired by the archangel were\r\nchanged to reverence and affection for the man.\r\n\r\nThis happy state of things continued while the two ate the supper; then,\r\nafter a prayer before the shrine, the hermit put the boy to bed, in a\r\nsmall adjoining room, tucking him in as snugly and lovingly as a mother\r\nmight; and so, with a parting caress, left him and sat down by the\r\nfire, and began to poke the brands about in an absent and aimless way.\r\nPresently he paused; then tapped his forehead several times with his\r\nfingers, as if trying to recall some thought which had escaped from his\r\nmind.  Apparently he was unsuccessful.  Now he started quickly up, and\r\nentered his guest’s room, and said--\r\n\r\n“Thou art King?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” was the response, drowsily uttered.\r\n\r\n“What King?”\r\n\r\n“Of England.”\r\n\r\n“Of England?  Then Henry is gone!”\r\n\r\n“Alack, it is so.  I am his son.”\r\n\r\nA black frown settled down upon the hermit’s face, and he clenched his\r\nbony hands with a vindictive energy.  He stood a few moments, breathing\r\nfast and swallowing repeatedly, then said in a husky voice--\r\n\r\n“Dost know it was he that turned us out into the world houseless and\r\nhomeless?”\r\n\r\nThere was no response.  The old man bent down and scanned the boy’s\r\nreposeful face and listened to his placid breathing.  “He sleeps--sleeps\r\nsoundly;” and the frown vanished away and gave place to an expression of\r\nevil satisfaction.  A smile flitted across the dreaming boy’s features.\r\nThe hermit muttered, “So--his heart is happy;” and he turned away.  He\r\nwent stealthily about the place, seeking here and there for something;\r\nnow and then halting to listen, now and then jerking his head around\r\nand casting a quick glance toward the bed; and always muttering, always\r\nmumbling to himself.  At last he found what he seemed to want--a rusty\r\nold butcher knife and a whetstone.  Then he crept to his place by the\r\nfire, sat himself down, and began to whet the knife softly on the stone,\r\nstill muttering, mumbling, ejaculating.  The winds sighed around the\r\nlonely place, the mysterious voices of the night floated by out of the\r\ndistances.  The shining eyes of venturesome mice and rats peered out at\r\nthe old man from cracks and coverts, but he went on with his work, rapt,\r\nabsorbed, and noted none of these things.\r\n\r\nAt long intervals he drew his thumb along the edge of his knife, and\r\nnodded his head with satisfaction.  “It grows sharper,” he said; “yes,\r\nit grows sharper.”\r\n\r\nHe took no note of the flight of time, but worked tranquilly on,\r\nentertaining himself with his thoughts, which broke out occasionally in\r\narticulate speech--\r\n\r\n“His father wrought us evil, he destroyed us--and is gone down into the\r\neternal fires!  Yes, down into the eternal fires!  He escaped us--but it\r\nwas God’s will, yes it was God’s will, we must not repine.  But he\r\nhath not escaped the fires!  No, he hath not escaped the fires, the\r\nconsuming, unpitying, remorseless fires--and _they_ are everlasting!”\r\n\r\nAnd so he wrought, and still wrought--mumbling, chuckling a low rasping\r\nchuckle at times--and at times breaking again into words--\r\n\r\n“It was his father that did it all.  I am but an archangel; but for him\r\nI should be pope!”\r\n\r\nThe King stirred.  The hermit sprang noiselessly to the bedside, and\r\nwent down upon his knees, bending over the prostrate form with his knife\r\nuplifted.  The boy stirred again; his eyes came open for an instant, but\r\nthere was no speculation in them, they saw nothing; the next moment his\r\ntranquil breathing showed that his sleep was sound once more.\r\n\r\nThe hermit watched and listened, for a time, keeping his position and\r\nscarcely breathing; then he slowly lowered his arms, and presently crept\r\naway, saying,--\r\n\r\n“It is long past midnight; it is not best that he should cry out, lest\r\nby accident someone be passing.”\r\n\r\nHe glided about his hovel, gathering a rag here, a thong there, and\r\nanother one yonder; then he returned, and by careful and gentle handling\r\nhe managed to tie the King’s ankles together without waking him.  Next\r\nhe essayed to tie the wrists; he made several attempts to cross them,\r\nbut the boy always drew one hand or the other away, just as the cord was\r\nready to be applied; but at last, when the archangel was almost ready\r\nto despair, the boy crossed his hands himself, and the next moment\r\nthey were bound. Now a bandage was passed under the sleeper’s chin and\r\nbrought up over his head and tied fast--and so softly, so gradually,\r\nand so deftly were the knots drawn together and compacted, that the boy\r\nslept peacefully through it all without stirring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI. Hendon to the rescue.\r\n\r\nThe old man glided away, stooping, stealthy, cat-like, and brought the\r\nlow bench.  He seated himself upon it, half his body in the dim and\r\nflickering light, and the other half in shadow; and so, with his craving\r\neyes bent upon the slumbering boy, he kept his patient vigil there,\r\nheedless of the drift of time, and softly whetted his knife, and mumbled\r\nand chuckled; and in aspect and attitude he resembled nothing so much as\r\na grizzly, monstrous spider, gloating over some hapless insect that lay\r\nbound and helpless in his web.\r\n\r\nAfter a long while, the old man, who was still gazing,--yet not seeing,\r\nhis mind having settled into a dreamy abstraction,--observed, on a\r\nsudden, that the boy’s eyes were open! wide open and staring!--staring\r\nup in frozen horror at the knife.  The smile of a gratified devil crept\r\nover the old man’s face, and he said, without changing his attitude or\r\nhis occupation--\r\n\r\n“Son of Henry the Eighth, hast thou prayed?”\r\n\r\nThe boy struggled helplessly in his bonds, and at the same time forced\r\na smothered sound through his closed jaws, which the hermit chose to\r\ninterpret as an affirmative answer to his question.\r\n\r\n“Then pray again.  Pray the prayer for the dying!”\r\n\r\nA shudder shook the boy’s frame, and his face blenched.  Then he\r\nstruggled again to free himself--turning and twisting himself this way\r\nand that; tugging frantically, fiercely, desperately--but uselessly--to\r\nburst his fetters; and all the while the old ogre smiled down upon him,\r\nand nodded his head, and placidly whetted his knife; mumbling, from time\r\nto time, “The moments are precious, they are few and precious--pray the\r\nprayer for the dying!”\r\n\r\nThe boy uttered a despairing groan, and ceased from his struggles,\r\npanting.  The tears came, then, and trickled, one after the other, down\r\nhis face; but this piteous sight wrought no softening effect upon the\r\nsavage old man.\r\n\r\nThe dawn was coming now; the hermit observed it, and spoke up sharply,\r\nwith a touch of nervous apprehension in his voice--\r\n\r\n“I may not indulge this ecstasy longer!  The night is already gone.  It\r\nseems but a moment--only a moment; would it had endured a year!  Seed of\r\nthe Church’s spoiler, close thy perishing eyes, an’ thou fearest to look\r\nupon--”\r\n\r\nThe rest was lost in inarticulate mutterings.  The old man sank upon his\r\nknees, his knife in his hand, and bent himself over the moaning boy.\r\n\r\nHark!  There was a sound of voices near the cabin--the knife dropped\r\nfrom the hermit’s hand; he cast a sheepskin over the boy and started up,\r\ntrembling.  The sounds increased, and presently the voices became rough\r\nand angry; then came blows, and cries for help; then a clatter of swift\r\nfootsteps, retreating.  Immediately came a succession of thundering\r\nknocks upon the cabin door, followed by--\r\n\r\n“Hullo-o-o!  Open!  And despatch, in the name of all the devils!”\r\n\r\nOh, this was the blessedest sound that had ever made music in the King’s\r\nears; for it was Miles Hendon’s voice!\r\n\r\nThe hermit, grinding his teeth in impotent rage, moved swiftly out of\r\nthe bedchamber, closing the door behind him; and straightway the King\r\nheard a talk, to this effect, proceeding from the ‘chapel’:--\r\n\r\n“Homage and greeting, reverend sir!  Where is the boy--_my_ boy?”\r\n\r\n“What boy, friend?”\r\n\r\n“What boy!  Lie me no lies, sir priest, play me no deceptions!--I am not\r\nin the humour for it.  Near to this place I caught the scoundrels who I\r\njudged did steal him from me, and I made them confess; they said he was\r\nat large again, and they had tracked him to your door.  They showed me\r\nhis very footprints.  Now palter no more; for look you, holy sir, an’\r\nthou produce him not--Where is the boy?”\r\n\r\n“O good sir, peradventure you mean the ragged regal vagrant that tarried\r\nhere the night.  If such as you take an interest in such as he, know,\r\nthen, that I have sent him of an errand.  He will be back anon.”\r\n\r\n“How soon?  How soon?  Come, waste not the time--cannot I overtake him?\r\nHow soon will he be back?”\r\n\r\n“Thou need’st not stir; he will return quickly.”\r\n\r\n“So be it, then.  I will try to wait.  But stop!--_you_ sent him of an\r\nerrand?--you!  Verily this is a lie--he would not go.  He would pull thy\r\nold beard, an’ thou didst offer him such an insolence. Thou hast lied,\r\nfriend; thou hast surely lied!  He would not go for thee, nor for any\r\nman.”\r\n\r\n“For any _man_--no; haply not.  But I am not a man.”\r\n\r\n“_What_!  Now o’ God’s name what art thou, then?”\r\n\r\n“It is a secret--mark thou reveal it not.  I am an archangel!”\r\n\r\nThere was a tremendous ejaculation from Miles Hendon--not altogether\r\nunprofane--followed by--\r\n\r\n“This doth well and truly account for his complaisance!  Right well\r\nI knew he would budge nor hand nor foot in the menial service of any\r\nmortal; but, lord, even a king must obey when an archangel gives the\r\nword o’ command!  Let me--‘sh!  What noise was that?”\r\n\r\nAll this while the little King had been yonder, alternately quaking with\r\nterror and trembling with hope; and all the while, too, he had thrown\r\nall the strength he could into his anguished moanings, constantly\r\nexpecting them to reach Hendon’s ear, but always realising, with\r\nbitterness, that they failed, or at least made no impression.  So this\r\nlast remark of his servant came as comes a reviving breath from fresh\r\nfields to the dying; and he exerted himself once more, and with all his\r\nenergy, just as the hermit was saying--\r\n\r\n“Noise?  I heard only the wind.”\r\n\r\n“Mayhap it was.  Yes, doubtless that was it.  I have been hearing it\r\nfaintly all the--there it is again!  It is not the wind!  What an odd\r\nsound!  Come, we will hunt it out!”\r\n\r\nNow the King’s joy was nearly insupportable.  His tired lungs did\r\ntheir utmost--and hopefully, too--but the sealed jaws and the muffling\r\nsheepskin sadly crippled the effort.  Then the poor fellow’s heart sank,\r\nto hear the hermit say--\r\n\r\n“Ah, it came from without--I think from the copse yonder.  Come, I will\r\nlead the way.”\r\n\r\nThe King heard the two pass out, talking; heard their footsteps die\r\nquickly away--then he was alone with a boding, brooding, awful silence.\r\n\r\nIt seemed an age till he heard the steps and voices approaching\r\nagain--and this time he heard an added sound,--the trampling of hoofs,\r\napparently.  Then he heard Hendon say--\r\n\r\n“I will not wait longer.  I _cannot_ wait longer.  He has lost his way\r\nin this thick wood.  Which direction took he?  Quick--point it out to\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“He--but wait; I will go with thee.”\r\n\r\n“Good--good!  Why, truly thou art better than thy looks.  Marry I do\r\nnot think there’s not another archangel with so right a heart as thine.\r\n Wilt ride?  Wilt take the wee donkey that’s for my boy, or wilt thou\r\nfork thy holy legs over this ill-conditioned slave of a mule that I have\r\nprovided for myself?--and had been cheated in too, had he cost but the\r\nindifferent sum of a month’s usury on a brass farthing let to a tinker\r\nout of work.”\r\n\r\n“No--ride thy mule, and lead thine ass; I am surer on mine own feet, and\r\nwill walk.”\r\n\r\n“Then prithee mind the little beast for me while I take my life in my\r\nhands and make what success I may toward mounting the big one.”\r\n\r\nThen followed a confusion of kicks, cuffs, tramplings and plungings,\r\naccompanied by a thunderous intermingling of volleyed curses, and\r\nfinally a bitter apostrophe to the mule, which must have broken its\r\nspirit, for hostilities seemed to cease from that moment.\r\n\r\nWith unutterable misery the fettered little King heard the voices and\r\nfootsteps fade away and die out.  All hope forsook him, now, for the\r\nmoment, and a dull despair settled down upon his heart. “My only friend\r\nis deceived and got rid of,” he said; “the hermit will return and--”  He\r\nfinished with a gasp; and at once fell to struggling so frantically with\r\nhis bonds again, that he shook off the smothering sheepskin.\r\n\r\nAnd now he heard the door open!  The sound chilled him to the\r\nmarrow--already he seemed to feel the knife at his throat.  Horror made\r\nhim close his eyes; horror made him open them again--and before him\r\nstood John Canty and Hugo!\r\n\r\nHe would have said “Thank God!” if his jaws had been free.\r\n\r\nA moment or two later his limbs were at liberty, and his captors, each\r\ngripping him by an arm, were hurrying him with all speed through the\r\nforest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII. A Victim of Treachery.\r\n\r\nOnce more ‘King Foo-foo the First’ was roving with the tramps and\r\noutlaws, a butt for their coarse jests and dull-witted railleries, and\r\nsometimes the victim of small spitefulness at the hands of Canty and\r\nHugo when the Ruffler’s back was turned.  None but Canty and Hugo really\r\ndisliked him.  Some of the others liked him, and all admired his pluck\r\nand spirit.  During two or three days, Hugo, in whose ward and charge\r\nthe King was, did what he covertly could to make the boy uncomfortable;\r\nand at night, during the customary orgies, he amused the company by\r\nputting small indignities upon him--always as if by accident.  Twice he\r\nstepped upon the King’s toes--accidentally--and the King, as became his\r\nroyalty, was contemptuously unconscious of it and indifferent to it; but\r\nthe third time Hugo entertained himself in that way, the King felled\r\nhim to the ground with a cudgel, to the prodigious delight of the tribe.\r\n Hugo, consumed with anger and shame, sprang up, seized a cudgel, and\r\ncame at his small adversary in a fury.  Instantly a ring was formed\r\naround the gladiators, and the betting and cheering began.\r\n\r\nBut poor Hugo stood no chance whatever.  His frantic and lubberly\r\n‘prentice-work found but a poor market for itself when pitted against\r\nan arm which had been trained by the first masters of Europe in\r\nsingle-stick, quarter-staff, and every art and trick of swordsmanship.\r\n The little King stood, alert but at graceful ease, and caught and\r\nturned aside the thick rain of blows with a facility and precision which\r\nset the motley on-lookers wild with admiration; and every now and then,\r\nwhen his practised eye detected an opening, and a lightning-swift rap\r\nupon Hugo’s head followed as a result, the storm of cheers and laughter\r\nthat swept the place was something wonderful to hear.  At the end of\r\nfifteen minutes, Hugo, all battered, bruised, and the target for\r\na pitiless bombardment of ridicule, slunk from the field; and the\r\nunscathed hero of the fight was seized and borne aloft upon the\r\nshoulders of the joyous rabble to the place of honour beside the\r\nRuffler, where with vast ceremony he was crowned King of the Game-Cocks;\r\nhis meaner title being at the same time solemnly cancelled and annulled,\r\nand a decree of banishment from the gang pronounced against any who\r\nshould thenceforth utter it.\r\n\r\nAll attempts to make the King serviceable to the troop had failed. He\r\nhad stubbornly refused to act; moreover, he was always trying to escape.\r\n He had been thrust into an unwatched kitchen, the first day of his\r\nreturn; he not only came forth empty-handed, but tried to rouse the\r\nhousemates. He was sent out with a tinker to help him at his work;\r\nhe would not work; moreover, he threatened the tinker with his own\r\nsoldering-iron; and finally both Hugo and the tinker found their\r\nhands full with the mere matter of keeping his from getting away.  He\r\ndelivered the thunders of his royalty upon the heads of all who hampered\r\nhis liberties or tried to force him to service.  He was sent out, in\r\nHugo’s charge, in company with a slatternly woman and a diseased baby,\r\nto beg; but the result was not encouraging--he declined to plead for the\r\nmendicants, or be a party to their cause in any way.\r\n\r\nThus several days went by; and the miseries of this tramping life, and\r\nthe weariness and sordidness and meanness and vulgarity of it, became\r\ngradually and steadily so intolerable to the captive that he began at\r\nlast to feel that his release from the hermit’s knife must prove only a\r\ntemporary respite from death, at best.\r\n\r\nBut at night, in his dreams, these things were forgotten, and he was\r\non his throne, and master again.  This, of course, intensified the\r\nsufferings of the awakening--so the mortifications of each succeeding\r\nmorning of the few that passed between his return to bondage and the\r\ncombat with Hugo, grew bitterer and bitterer, and harder and harder to\r\nbear.\r\n\r\nThe morning after that combat, Hugo got up with a heart filled with\r\nvengeful purposes against the King.  He had two plans, in particular.\r\nOne was to inflict upon the lad what would be, to his proud spirit\r\nand ‘imagined’ royalty, a peculiar humiliation; and if he failed to\r\naccomplish this, his other plan was to put a crime of some kind upon the\r\nKing, and then betray him into the implacable clutches of the law.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the first plan, he purposed to put a ‘clime’ upon the\r\nKing’s leg; rightly judging that that would mortify him to the last and\r\nperfect degree; and as soon as the clime should operate, he meant to get\r\nCanty’s help, and _force_ the King to expose his leg in the highway\r\nand beg for alms.  ‘Clime’ was the cant term for a sore, artificially\r\ncreated. To make a clime, the operator made a paste or poultice of\r\nunslaked lime, soap, and the rust of old iron, and spread it upon a\r\npiece of leather, which was then bound tightly upon the leg.  This would\r\npresently fret off the skin, and make the flesh raw and angry-looking;\r\nblood was then rubbed upon the limb, which, being fully dried, took on a\r\ndark and repulsive colour.  Then a bandage of soiled rags was put on in\r\na cleverly careless way which would allow the hideous ulcer to be seen,\r\nand move the compassion of the passer-by. {8}\r\n\r\nHugo got the help of the tinker whom the King had cowed with the\r\nsoldering-iron; they took the boy out on a tinkering tramp, and as soon\r\nas they were out of sight of the camp they threw him down and the tinker\r\nheld him while Hugo bound the poultice tight and fast upon his leg.\r\n\r\nThe King raged and stormed, and promised to hang the two the moment the\r\nsceptre was in his hand again; but they kept a firm grip upon him\r\nand enjoyed his impotent struggling and jeered at his threats.  This\r\ncontinued until the poultice began to bite; and in no long time its work\r\nwould have been perfected, if there had been no interruption.  But there\r\nwas; for about this time the ‘slave’ who had made the speech denouncing\r\nEngland’s laws, appeared on the scene, and put an end to the enterprise,\r\nand stripped off the poultice and bandage.\r\n\r\nThe King wanted to borrow his deliverer’s cudgel and warm the jackets\r\nof the two rascals on the spot; but the man said no, it would bring\r\ntrouble--leave the matter till night; the whole tribe being together,\r\nthen, the outside world would not venture to interfere or interrupt.  He\r\nmarched the party back to camp and reported the affair to the Ruffler,\r\nwho listened, pondered, and then decided that the King should not be\r\nagain detailed to beg, since it was plain he was worthy of something\r\nhigher and better--wherefore, on the spot he promoted him from the\r\nmendicant rank and appointed him to steal!\r\n\r\nHugo was overjoyed.  He had already tried to make the King steal, and\r\nfailed; but there would be no more trouble of that sort, now, for of\r\ncourse the King would not dream of defying a distinct command delivered\r\ndirectly from head-quarters.  So he planned a raid for that very\r\nafternoon, purposing to get the King in the law’s grip in the course of\r\nit; and to do it, too, with such ingenious strategy, that it should seem\r\nto be accidental and unintentional; for the King of the Game-Cocks was\r\npopular now, and the gang might not deal over-gently with an unpopular\r\nmember who played so serious a treachery upon him as the delivering him\r\nover to the common enemy, the law.\r\n\r\nVery well.  All in good time Hugo strolled off to a neighbouring village\r\nwith his prey; and the two drifted slowly up and down one street after\r\nanother, the one watching sharply for a sure chance to achieve his evil\r\npurpose, and the other watching as sharply for a chance to dart away and\r\nget free of his infamous captivity for ever.\r\n\r\nBoth threw away some tolerably fair-looking opportunities; for both,\r\nin their secret hearts, were resolved to make absolutely sure work this\r\ntime, and neither meant to allow his fevered desires to seduce him into\r\nany venture that had much uncertainty about it.\r\n\r\nHugo’s chance came first.  For at last a woman approached who carried a\r\nfat package of some sort in a basket.  Hugo’s eyes sparkled with sinful\r\npleasure as he said to himself, “Breath o’ my life, an’ I can but\r\nput _that_ upon him, ’tis good-den and God keep thee, King of the\r\nGame-Cocks!” He waited and watched--outwardly patient, but inwardly\r\nconsuming with excitement--till the woman had passed by, and the time\r\nwas ripe; then said, in a low voice--\r\n\r\n“Tarry here till I come again,” and darted stealthily after the prey.\r\n\r\nThe King’s heart was filled with joy--he could make his escape, now, if\r\nHugo’s quest only carried him far enough away.\r\n\r\nBut he was to have no such luck.  Hugo crept behind the woman, snatched\r\nthe package, and came running back, wrapping it in an old piece of\r\nblanket which he carried on his arm.  The hue and cry was raised in a\r\nmoment, by the woman, who knew her loss by the lightening of her burden,\r\nalthough she had not seen the pilfering done.  Hugo thrust the bundle\r\ninto the King’s hands without halting, saying--\r\n\r\n“Now speed ye after me with the rest, and cry ‘Stop thief!’ but mind ye\r\nlead them astray!”\r\n\r\nThe next moment Hugo turned a corner and darted down a crooked\r\nalley--and in another moment or two he lounged into view again, looking\r\ninnocent and indifferent, and took up a position behind a post to watch\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe insulted King threw the bundle on the ground; and the blanket fell\r\naway from it just as the woman arrived, with an augmenting crowd at her\r\nheels; she seized the King’s wrist with one hand, snatched up her bundle\r\nwith the other, and began to pour out a tirade of abuse upon the boy\r\nwhile he struggled, without success, to free himself from her grip.\r\n\r\nHugo had seen enough--his enemy was captured and the law would get him,\r\nnow--so he slipped away, jubilant and chuckling, and wended campwards,\r\nframing a judicious version of the matter to give to the Ruffler’s crew\r\nas he strode along.\r\n\r\nThe King continued to struggle in the woman’s strong grasp, and now and\r\nthen cried out in vexation--\r\n\r\n“Unhand me, thou foolish creature; it was not I that bereaved thee of\r\nthy paltry goods.”\r\n\r\nThe crowd closed around, threatening the King and calling him names; a\r\nbrawny blacksmith in leather apron, and sleeves rolled to his elbows,\r\nmade a reach for him, saying he would trounce him well, for a lesson;\r\nbut just then a long sword flashed in the air and fell with convincing\r\nforce upon the man’s arm, flat side down, the fantastic owner of it\r\nremarking pleasantly, at the same time--\r\n\r\n“Marry, good souls, let us proceed gently, not with ill blood and\r\nuncharitable words.  This is matter for the law’s consideration,\r\nnot private and unofficial handling.  Loose thy hold from the boy,\r\ngoodwife.”\r\n\r\nThe blacksmith averaged the stalwart soldier with a glance, then went\r\nmuttering away, rubbing his arm; the woman released the boy’s wrist\r\nreluctantly; the crowd eyed the stranger unlovingly, but prudently\r\nclosed their mouths.  The King sprang to his deliverer’s side, with\r\nflushed cheeks and sparkling eyes, exclaiming--\r\n\r\n“Thou hast lagged sorely, but thou comest in good season, now, Sir\r\nMiles; carve me this rabble to rags!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII. The Prince a prisoner.\r\n\r\nHendon forced back a smile, and bent down and whispered in the King’s\r\near--\r\n\r\n“Softly, softly, my prince, wag thy tongue warily--nay, suffer it not to\r\nwag at all.  Trust in me--all shall go well in the end.” Then he added\r\nto himself:  “_Sir_ Miles!  Bless me, I had totally forgot I was a\r\nknight! Lord, how marvellous a thing it is, the grip his memory doth\r\ntake upon his quaint and crazy fancies! . . . An empty and foolish title\r\nis mine, and yet it is something to have deserved it; for I think it is\r\nmore honour to be held worthy to be a spectre-knight in his Kingdom of\r\nDreams and Shadows, than to be held base enough to be an earl in some of\r\nthe _real_ kingdoms of this world.”\r\n\r\nThe crowd fell apart to admit a constable, who approached and was about\r\nto lay his hand upon the King’s shoulder, when Hendon said--\r\n\r\n“Gently, good friend, withhold your hand--he shall go peaceably; I am\r\nresponsible for that.  Lead on, we will follow.”\r\n\r\nThe officer led, with the woman and her bundle; Miles and the King\r\nfollowed after, with the crowd at their heels.  The King was inclined to\r\nrebel; but Hendon said to him in a low voice--\r\n\r\n“Reflect, Sire--your laws are the wholesome breath of your own royalty;\r\nshall their source resist them, yet require the branches to respect\r\nthem? Apparently one of these laws has been broken; when the King is on\r\nhis throne again, can it ever grieve him to remember that when he was\r\nseemingly a private person he loyally sank the king in the citizen and\r\nsubmitted to its authority?”\r\n\r\n“Thou art right; say no more; thou shalt see that whatsoever the King\r\nof England requires a subject to suffer, under the law, he will himself\r\nsuffer while he holdeth the station of a subject.”\r\n\r\nWhen the woman was called upon to testify before the justice of the\r\npeace, she swore that the small prisoner at the bar was the person who\r\nhad committed the theft; there was none able to show the contrary, so\r\nthe King stood convicted.  The bundle was now unrolled, and when the\r\ncontents proved to be a plump little dressed pig, the judge looked\r\ntroubled, whilst Hendon turned pale, and his body was thrilled with an\r\nelectric shiver of dismay; but the King remained unmoved, protected\r\nby his ignorance.  The judge meditated, during an ominous pause, then\r\nturned to the woman, with the question--\r\n\r\n“What dost thou hold this property to be worth?”\r\n\r\nThe woman courtesied and replied--\r\n\r\n“Three shillings and eightpence, your worship--I could not abate a penny\r\nand set forth the value honestly.”\r\n\r\nThe justice glanced around uncomfortably upon the crowd, then nodded to\r\nthe constable, and said--\r\n\r\n“Clear the court and close the doors.”\r\n\r\nIt was done.  None remained but the two officials, the accused, the\r\naccuser, and Miles Hendon.  This latter was rigid and colourless, and\r\non his forehead big drops of cold sweat gathered, broke and blended\r\ntogether, and trickled down his face.  The judge turned to the woman\r\nagain, and said, in a compassionate voice--\r\n\r\n“‘Tis a poor ignorant lad, and mayhap was driven hard by hunger, for\r\nthese be grievous times for the unfortunate; mark you, he hath not an\r\nevil face--but when hunger driveth--Good woman! dost know that when one\r\nsteals a thing above the value of thirteenpence ha’penny the law saith\r\nhe shall _hang_ for it?”\r\n\r\nThe little King started, wide-eyed with consternation, but controlled\r\nhimself and held his peace; but not so the woman.  She sprang to her\r\nfeet, shaking with fright, and cried out--\r\n\r\n“Oh, good lack, what have I done!  God-a-mercy, I would not hang\r\nthe poor thing for the whole world!  Ah, save me from this, your\r\nworship--what shall I do, what _can_ I do?”\r\n\r\nThe justice maintained his judicial composure, and simply said--\r\n\r\n“Doubtless it is allowable to revise the value, since it is not yet writ\r\nupon the record.”\r\n\r\n“Then in God’s name call the pig eightpence, and heaven bless the day\r\nthat freed my conscience of this awesome thing!”\r\n\r\nMiles Hendon forgot all decorum in his delight; and surprised the King\r\nand wounded his dignity, by throwing his arms around him and hugging\r\nhim. The woman made her grateful adieux and started away with her pig;\r\nand when the constable opened the door for her, he followed her out into\r\nthe narrow hall.  The justice proceeded to write in his record book.\r\n Hendon, always alert, thought he would like to know why the officer\r\nfollowed the woman out; so he slipped softly into the dusky hall and\r\nlistened.  He heard a conversation to this effect--\r\n\r\n“It is a fat pig, and promises good eating; I will buy it of thee; here\r\nis the eightpence.”\r\n\r\n“Eightpence, indeed!  Thou’lt do no such thing.  It cost me three\r\nshillings and eightpence, good honest coin of the last reign, that old\r\nHarry that’s just dead ne’er touched or tampered with.  A fig for thy\r\neightpence!”\r\n\r\n“Stands the wind in that quarter?  Thou wast under oath, and so swore\r\nfalsely when thou saidst the value was but eightpence.  Come straightway\r\nback with me before his worship, and answer for the crime!--and then the\r\nlad will hang.”\r\n\r\n“There, there, dear heart, say no more, I am content.  Give me the\r\neightpence, and hold thy peace about the matter.”\r\n\r\nThe woman went off crying:  Hendon slipped back into the court room,\r\nand the constable presently followed, after hiding his prize in some\r\nconvenient place.  The justice wrote a while longer, then read the King\r\na wise and kindly lecture, and sentenced him to a short imprisonment\r\nin the common jail, to be followed by a public flogging.  The astounded\r\nKing opened his mouth, and was probably going to order the good judge to\r\nbe beheaded on the spot; but he caught a warning sign from Hendon, and\r\nsucceeded in closing his mouth again before he lost anything out of it.\r\nHendon took him by the hand, now, made reverence to the justice, and the\r\ntwo departed in the wake of the constable toward the jail.  The moment\r\nthe street was reached, the inflamed monarch halted, snatched away his\r\nhand, and exclaimed--\r\n\r\n“Idiot, dost imagine I will enter a common jail _alive_?”\r\n\r\nHendon bent down and said, somewhat sharply--\r\n\r\n“_Will_ you trust in me?  Peace! and forbear to worsen our chances with\r\ndangerous speech.  What God wills, will happen; thou canst not hurry it,\r\nthou canst not alter it; therefore wait, and be patient--‘twill be time\r\nenow to rail or rejoice when what is to happen has happened.” {1}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV. The Escape.\r\n\r\nThe short winter day was nearly ended.  The streets were deserted, save\r\nfor a few random stragglers, and these hurried straight along, with the\r\nintent look of people who were only anxious to accomplish their errands\r\nas quickly as possible, and then snugly house themselves from the rising\r\nwind and the gathering twilight. They looked neither to the right nor to\r\nthe left; they paid no attention to our party, they did not even seem\r\nto see them. Edward the Sixth wondered if the spectacle of a king on his\r\nway to jail had ever encountered such marvellous indifference before.\r\nBy-and-by the constable arrived at a deserted market-square, and\r\nproceeded to cross it.  When he had reached the middle of it, Hendon\r\nlaid his hand upon his arm, and said in a low voice--\r\n\r\n“Bide a moment, good sir, there is none in hearing, and I would say a\r\nword to thee.”\r\n\r\n“My duty forbids it, sir; prithee hinder me not, the night comes on.”\r\n\r\n“Stay, nevertheless, for the matter concerns thee nearly.  Turn thy back\r\na moment and seem not to see:  _let this poor lad escape_.”\r\n\r\n“This to me, sir!  I arrest thee in--”\r\n\r\n“Nay, be not too hasty.  See thou be careful and commit no foolish\r\nerror,”--then he shut his voice down to a whisper, and said in the man’s\r\near--“the pig thou hast purchased for eightpence may cost thee thy neck,\r\nman!”\r\n\r\nThe poor constable, taken by surprise, was speechless, at first, then\r\nfound his tongue and fell to blustering and threatening; but Hendon\r\nwas tranquil, and waited with patience till his breath was spent; then\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n“I have a liking to thee, friend, and would not willingly see thee\r\ncome to harm.  Observe, I heard it all--every word.  I will prove it to\r\nthee.” Then he repeated the conversation which the officer and the woman\r\nhad had together in the hall, word for word, and ended with--\r\n\r\n“There--have I set it forth correctly?  Should not I be able to set it\r\nforth correctly before the judge, if occasion required?”\r\n\r\nThe man was dumb with fear and distress, for a moment; then he rallied,\r\nand said with forced lightness--\r\n\r\n“‘Tis making a mighty matter, indeed, out of a jest; I but plagued the\r\nwoman for mine amusement.”\r\n\r\n“Kept you the woman’s pig for amusement?”\r\n\r\nThe man answered sharply--\r\n\r\n“Nought else, good sir--I tell thee ’twas but a jest.”\r\n\r\n“I do begin to believe thee,” said Hendon, with a perplexing mixture of\r\nmockery and half-conviction in his tone; “but tarry thou here a\r\nmoment whilst I run and ask his worship--for nathless, he being a man\r\nexperienced in law, in jests, in--”\r\n\r\nHe was moving away, still talking; the constable hesitated, fidgeted,\r\nspat out an oath or two, then cried out--\r\n\r\n“Hold, hold, good sir--prithee wait a little--the judge!  Why, man, he\r\nhath no more sympathy with a jest than hath a dead corpse!--come, and we\r\nwill speak further.  Ods body!  I seem to be in evil case--and all for\r\nan innocent and thoughtless pleasantry. I am a man of family; and my\r\nwife and little ones--List to reason, good your worship: what wouldst\r\nthou of me?”\r\n\r\n“Only that thou be blind and dumb and paralytic whilst one may count a\r\nhundred thousand--counting slowly,” said Hendon, with the expression of\r\na man who asks but a reasonable favour, and that a very little one.\r\n\r\n“It is my destruction!” said the constable despairingly.  “Ah, be\r\nreasonable, good sir; only look at this matter, on all its sides, and\r\nsee how mere a jest it is--how manifestly and how plainly it is so.  And\r\neven if one granted it were not a jest, it is a fault so small that\r\ne’en the grimmest penalty it could call forth would be but a rebuke and\r\nwarning from the judge’s lips.”\r\n\r\nHendon replied with a solemnity which chilled the air about him--\r\n\r\n“This jest of thine hath a name, in law,--wot you what it is?”\r\n\r\n“I knew it not!  Peradventure I have been unwise.  I never dreamed it\r\nhad a name--ah, sweet heaven, I thought it was original.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it hath a name.  In the law this crime is called Non compos mentis\r\nlex talionis sic transit gloria mundi.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my God!”\r\n\r\n“And the penalty is death!”\r\n\r\n“God be merciful to me a sinner!”\r\n\r\n“By advantage taken of one in fault, in dire peril, and at thy mercy,\r\nthou hast seized goods worth above thirteenpence ha’penny, paying but\r\na trifle for the same; and this, in the eye of the law, is constructive\r\nbarratry, misprision of treason, malfeasance in office, ad hominem\r\nexpurgatis in statu quo--and the penalty is death by the halter, without\r\nransom, commutation, or benefit of clergy.”\r\n\r\n“Bear me up, bear me up, sweet sir, my legs do fail me!  Be thou\r\nmerciful--spare me this doom, and I will turn my back and see nought\r\nthat shall happen.”\r\n\r\n“Good! now thou’rt wise and reasonable.  And thou’lt restore the pig?”\r\n\r\n“I will, I will indeed--nor ever touch another, though heaven send it\r\nand an archangel fetch it.  Go--I am blind for thy sake--I see nothing.\r\n I will say thou didst break in and wrest the prisoner from my hands by\r\nforce.  It is but a crazy, ancient door--I will batter it down myself\r\nbetwixt midnight and the morning.”\r\n\r\n“Do it, good soul, no harm will come of it; the judge hath a loving\r\ncharity for this poor lad, and will shed no tears and break no jailer’s\r\nbones for his escape.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV. Hendon Hall.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Hendon and the King were out of sight of the constable, his\r\nMajesty was instructed to hurry to a certain place outside the town, and\r\nwait there, whilst Hendon should go to the inn and settle his account.\r\nHalf an hour later the two friends were blithely jogging eastward on\r\nHendon’s sorry steeds.  The King was warm and comfortable, now, for\r\nhe had cast his rags and clothed himself in the second-hand suit which\r\nHendon had bought on London Bridge.\r\n\r\nHendon wished to guard against over-fatiguing the boy; he judged that\r\nhard journeys, irregular meals, and illiberal measures of sleep would be\r\nbad for his crazed mind; whilst rest, regularity, and moderate exercise\r\nwould be pretty sure to hasten its cure; he longed to see the stricken\r\nintellect made well again and its diseased visions driven out of the\r\ntormented little head; therefore he resolved to move by easy stages\r\ntoward the home whence he had so long been banished, instead of obeying\r\nthe impulse of his impatience and hurrying along night and day.\r\n\r\nWhen he and the King had journeyed about ten miles, they reached a\r\nconsiderable village, and halted there for the night, at a good inn.\r\n The former relations were resumed; Hendon stood behind the King’s\r\nchair, while he dined, and waited upon him; undressed him when he was\r\nready for bed; then took the floor for his own quarters, and slept\r\nathwart the door, rolled up in a blanket.\r\n\r\nThe next day, and the day after, they jogged lazily along talking\r\nover the adventures they had met since their separation, and mightily\r\nenjoying each other’s narratives.  Hendon detailed all his wide\r\nwanderings in search of the King, and described how the archangel had\r\nled him a fool’s journey all over the forest, and taken him back to\r\nthe hut, finally, when he found he could not get rid of him.  Then--he\r\nsaid--the old man went into the bedchamber and came staggering back\r\nlooking broken-hearted, and saying he had expected to find that the boy\r\nhad returned and laid down in there to rest, but it was not so.  Hendon\r\nhad waited at the hut all day; hope of the King’s return died out, then,\r\nand he departed upon the quest again.\r\n\r\n“And old Sanctum Sanctorum _was_ truly sorry your highness came not\r\nback,” said Hendon; “I saw it in his face.”\r\n\r\n“Marry I will never doubt _that_!” said the King--and then told his own\r\nstory; after which, Hendon was sorry he had not destroyed the archangel.\r\n\r\nDuring the last day of the trip, Hendon’s spirits were soaring. His\r\ntongue ran constantly.  He talked about his old father, and his brother\r\nArthur, and told of many things which illustrated their high and\r\ngenerous characters; he went into loving frenzies over his Edith,\r\nand was so glad-hearted that he was even able to say some gentle and\r\nbrotherly things about Hugh.  He dwelt a deal on the coming meeting\r\nat Hendon Hall; what a surprise it would be to everybody, and what an\r\noutburst of thanksgiving and delight there would be.\r\n\r\nIt was a fair region, dotted with cottages and orchards, and the road\r\nled through broad pasture lands whose receding expanses, marked with\r\ngentle elevations and depressions, suggested the swelling and subsiding\r\nundulations of the sea.  In the afternoon the returning prodigal made\r\nconstant deflections from his course to see if by ascending some hillock\r\nhe might not pierce the distance and catch a glimpse of his home.  At\r\nlast he was successful, and cried out excitedly--\r\n\r\n“There is the village, my Prince, and there is the Hall close by! You\r\nmay see the towers from here; and that wood there--that is my father’s\r\npark. Ah, _now_ thou’lt know what state and grandeur be! A house with\r\nseventy rooms--think of that!--and seven and twenty servants!  A brave\r\nlodging for such as we, is it not so?  Come, let us speed--my impatience\r\nwill not brook further delay.”\r\n\r\nAll possible hurry was made; still, it was after three o’clock before\r\nthe village was reached.  The travellers scampered through it, Hendon’s\r\ntongue going all the time.  “Here is the church--covered with the same\r\nivy--none gone, none added.”  “Yonder is the inn, the old Red Lion,--and\r\nyonder is the market-place.”  “Here is the Maypole, and here the\r\npump--nothing is altered; nothing but the people, at any rate; ten years\r\nmake a change in people; some of these I seem to know, but none know\r\nme.”  So his chat ran on. The end of the village was soon reached; then\r\nthe travellers struck into a crooked, narrow road, walled in with tall\r\nhedges, and hurried briskly along it for half a mile, then passed into a\r\nvast flower garden through an imposing gateway, whose huge stone pillars\r\nbore sculptured armorial devices.  A noble mansion was before them.\r\n\r\n“Welcome to Hendon Hall, my King!” exclaimed Miles.  “Ah, ’tis a great\r\nday!  My father and my brother, and the Lady Edith will be so mad with\r\njoy that they will have eyes and tongue for none but me in the first\r\ntransports of the meeting, and so thou’lt seem but coldly welcomed--but\r\nmind it not; ’twill soon seem otherwise; for when I say thou art my\r\nward, and tell them how costly is my love for thee, thou’lt see them\r\ntake thee to their breasts for Miles Hendon’s sake, and make their house\r\nand hearts thy home for ever after!”\r\n\r\nThe next moment Hendon sprang to the ground before the great door,\r\nhelped the King down, then took him by the hand and rushed within. A few\r\nsteps brought him to a spacious apartment; he entered, seated the King\r\nwith more hurry than ceremony, then ran toward a young man who sat at a\r\nwriting-table in front of a generous fire of logs.\r\n\r\n“Embrace me, Hugh,” he cried, “and say thou’rt glad I am come again! and\r\ncall our father, for home is not home till I shall touch his hand, and\r\nsee his face, and hear his voice once more!”\r\n\r\nBut Hugh only drew back, after betraying a momentary surprise, and bent\r\na grave stare upon the intruder--a stare which indicated somewhat of\r\noffended dignity, at first, then changed, in response to some inward\r\nthought or purpose, to an expression of marvelling curiosity, mixed with\r\na real or assumed compassion.  Presently he said, in a mild voice--\r\n\r\n“Thy wits seem touched, poor stranger; doubtless thou hast suffered\r\nprivations and rude buffetings at the world’s hands; thy looks and dress\r\nbetoken it.  Whom dost thou take me to be?”\r\n\r\n“Take thee?  Prithee for whom else than whom thou art?  I take thee to\r\nbe Hugh Hendon,” said Miles, sharply.\r\n\r\nThe other continued, in the same soft tone--\r\n\r\n“And whom dost thou imagine thyself to be?”\r\n\r\n“Imagination hath nought to do with it!  Dost thou pretend thou knowest\r\nme not for thy brother Miles Hendon?”\r\n\r\nAn expression of pleased surprise flitted across Hugh’s face, and he\r\nexclaimed--\r\n\r\n“What! thou art not jesting? can the dead come to life?  God be praised\r\nif it be so!  Our poor lost boy restored to our arms after all these\r\ncruel years!  Ah, it seems too good to be true, it _is_ too good to be\r\ntrue--I charge thee, have pity, do not trifle with me!  Quick--come to\r\nthe light--let me scan thee well!”\r\n\r\nHe seized Miles by the arm, dragged him to the window, and began to\r\ndevour him from head to foot with his eyes, turning him this way and\r\nthat, and stepping briskly around him and about him to prove him\r\nfrom all points of view; whilst the returned prodigal, all aglow with\r\ngladness, smiled, laughed, and kept nodding his head and saying--\r\n\r\n“Go on, brother, go on, and fear not; thou’lt find nor limb nor feature\r\nthat cannot bide the test.  Scour and scan me to thy content, my good\r\nold Hugh--I am indeed thy old Miles, thy same old Miles, thy lost\r\nbrother, is’t not so?  Ah, ’tis a great day--I _said_ ’twas a great day!\r\n Give me thy hand, give me thy cheek--lord, I am like to die of very\r\njoy!”\r\n\r\nHe was about to throw himself upon his brother; but Hugh put up his hand\r\nin dissent, then dropped his chin mournfully upon his breast, saying\r\nwith emotion--\r\n\r\n“Ah, God of his mercy give me strength to bear this grievous\r\ndisappointment!”\r\n\r\nMiles, amazed, could not speak for a moment; then he found his tongue,\r\nand cried out--\r\n\r\n“_What_ disappointment?  Am I not thy brother?”\r\n\r\nHugh shook his head sadly, and said--\r\n\r\n“I pray heaven it may prove so, and that other eyes may find the\r\nresemblances that are hid from mine.  Alack, I fear me the letter spoke\r\nbut too truly.”\r\n\r\n“What letter?”\r\n\r\n“One that came from over sea, some six or seven years ago.  It said my\r\nbrother died in battle.”\r\n\r\n“It was a lie!  Call thy father--he will know me.”\r\n\r\n“One may not call the dead.”\r\n\r\n“Dead?” Miles’s voice was subdued, and his lips trembled.  “My father\r\ndead!--oh, this is heavy news.  Half my new joy is withered now.\r\n Prithee let me see my brother Arthur--he will know me; he will know me\r\nand console me.”\r\n\r\n“He, also, is dead.”\r\n\r\n“God be merciful to me, a stricken man!  Gone,--both gone--the worthy\r\ntaken and the worthless spared, in me!  Ah! I crave your mercy!--do not\r\nsay the Lady Edith--”\r\n\r\n“Is dead?  No, she lives.”\r\n\r\n“Then, God be praised, my joy is whole again!  Speed thee, brother--let\r\nher come to me!  An’ _she_ say I am not myself--but she will not; no,\r\nno, _she_ will know me, I were a fool to doubt it. Bring her--bring the\r\nold servants; they, too, will know me.”\r\n\r\n“All are gone but five--Peter, Halsey, David, Bernard, and Margaret.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, Hugh left the room.  Miles stood musing a while, then began\r\nto walk the floor, muttering--\r\n\r\n“The five arch-villains have survived the two-and-twenty leal and\r\nhonest--‘tis an odd thing.”\r\n\r\nHe continued walking back and forth, muttering to himself; he had\r\nforgotten the King entirely.  By-and-by his Majesty said gravely, and\r\nwith a touch of genuine compassion, though the words themselves were\r\ncapable of being interpreted ironically--\r\n\r\n“Mind not thy mischance, good man; there be others in the world whose\r\nidentity is denied, and whose claims are derided.  Thou hast company.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my King,” cried Hendon, colouring slightly, “do not thou condemn\r\nme--wait, and thou shalt see.  I am no impostor--she will say it; you\r\nshall hear it from the sweetest lips in England.  I an impostor?  Why, I\r\nknow this old hall, these pictures of my ancestors, and all these things\r\nthat are about us, as a child knoweth its own nursery.  Here was I born\r\nand bred, my lord; I speak the truth; I would not deceive thee; and\r\nshould none else believe, I pray thee do not _thou_ doubt me--I could\r\nnot bear it.”\r\n\r\n“I do not doubt thee,” said the King, with a childlike simplicity and\r\nfaith.\r\n\r\n“I thank thee out of my heart!” exclaimed Hendon with a fervency which\r\nshowed that he was touched.  The King added, with the same gentle\r\nsimplicity--\r\n\r\n“Dost thou doubt _me_?”\r\n\r\nA guilty confusion seized upon Hendon, and he was grateful that the door\r\nopened to admit Hugh, at that moment, and saved him the necessity of\r\nreplying.\r\n\r\nA beautiful lady, richly clothed, followed Hugh, and after her came\r\nseveral liveried servants.  The lady walked slowly, with her head bowed\r\nand her eyes fixed upon the floor.  The face was unspeakably sad.  Miles\r\nHendon sprang forward, crying out--\r\n\r\n“Oh, my Edith, my darling--”\r\n\r\nBut Hugh waved him back, gravely, and said to the lady--\r\n\r\n“Look upon him.  Do you know him?”\r\n\r\nAt the sound of Miles’s voice the woman had started slightly, and her\r\ncheeks had flushed; she was trembling now.  She stood still, during an\r\nimpressive pause of several moments; then slowly lifted up her head and\r\nlooked into Hendon’s eyes with a stony and frightened gaze; the blood\r\nsank out of her face, drop by drop, till nothing remained but the grey\r\npallor of death; then she said, in a voice as dead as the face, “I know\r\nhim not!” and turned, with a moan and a stifled sob, and tottered out of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nMiles Hendon sank into a chair and covered his face with his hands.\r\nAfter a pause, his brother said to the servants--\r\n\r\n“You have observed him.  Do you know him?”\r\n\r\nThey shook their heads; then the master said--\r\n\r\n“The servants know you not, sir.  I fear there is some mistake. You have\r\nseen that my wife knew you not.”\r\n\r\n“Thy _wife_!”  In an instant Hugh was pinned to the wall, with an iron\r\ngrip about his throat.  “Oh, thou fox-hearted slave, I see it all!\r\n Thou’st writ the lying letter thyself, and my stolen bride and goods\r\nare its fruit.  There--now get thee gone, lest I shame mine honourable\r\nsoldiership with the slaying of so pitiful a mannikin!”\r\n\r\nHugh, red-faced, and almost suffocated, reeled to the nearest chair, and\r\ncommanded the servants to seize and bind the murderous stranger.  They\r\nhesitated, and one of them said--\r\n\r\n“He is armed, Sir Hugh, and we are weaponless.”\r\n\r\n“Armed!  What of it, and ye so many?  Upon him, I say!”\r\n\r\nBut Miles warned them to be careful what they did, and added--\r\n\r\n“Ye know me of old--I have not changed; come on, an’ it like you.”\r\n\r\nThis reminder did not hearten the servants much; they still held back.\r\n\r\n“Then go, ye paltry cowards, and arm yourselves and guard the doors,\r\nwhilst I send one to fetch the watch!” said Hugh.  He turned at the\r\nthreshold, and said to Miles, “You’ll find it to your advantage to\r\noffend not with useless endeavours at escape.”\r\n\r\n“Escape?  Spare thyself discomfort, an’ that is all that troubles thee.\r\nFor Miles Hendon is master of Hendon Hall and all its belongings.  He\r\nwill remain--doubt it not.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI. Disowned.\r\n\r\nThe King sat musing a few moments, then looked up and said--\r\n\r\n“‘Tis strange--most strange.  I cannot account for it.”\r\n\r\n“No, it is not strange, my liege.  I know him, and this conduct is but\r\nnatural.  He was a rascal from his birth.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I spake not of _him_, Sir Miles.”\r\n\r\n“Not of him?  Then of what?  What is it that is strange?”\r\n\r\n“That the King is not missed.”\r\n\r\n“How?  Which?  I doubt I do not understand.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?  Doth it not strike you as being passing strange that the land\r\nis not filled with couriers and proclamations describing my person and\r\nmaking search for me?  Is it no matter for commotion and distress that\r\nthe Head of the State is gone; that I am vanished away and lost?”\r\n\r\n“Most true, my King, I had forgot.”  Then Hendon sighed, and muttered to\r\nhimself, “Poor ruined mind--still busy with its pathetic dream.”\r\n\r\n“But I have a plan that shall right us both--I will write a paper, in\r\nthree tongues--Latin, Greek and English--and thou shalt haste away with\r\nit to London in the morning.  Give it to none but my uncle, the Lord\r\nHertford; when he shall see it, he will know and say I wrote it.  Then\r\nhe will send for me.”\r\n\r\n“Might it not be best, my Prince, that we wait here until I prove myself\r\nand make my rights secure to my domains?  I should be so much the better\r\nable then to--”\r\n\r\nThe King interrupted him imperiously--\r\n\r\n“Peace!  What are thy paltry domains, thy trivial interests, contrasted\r\nwith matters which concern the weal of a nation and the integrity of a\r\nthrone?”  Then, he added, in a gentle voice, as if he were sorry for his\r\nseverity, “Obey, and have no fear; I will right thee, I will make thee\r\nwhole--yes, more than whole.  I shall remember, and requite.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, he took the pen, and set himself to work.  Hendon\r\ncontemplated him lovingly a while, then said to himself--\r\n\r\n“An’ it were dark, I should think it _was_ a king that spoke; there’s\r\nno denying it, when the humour’s upon on him he doth thunder and lighten\r\nlike your true King; now where got he that trick?  See him scribble and\r\nscratch away contentedly at his meaningless pot-hooks, fancying them to\r\nbe Latin and Greek--and except my wit shall serve me with a lucky device\r\nfor diverting him from his purpose, I shall be forced to pretend to post\r\naway to-morrow on this wild errand he hath invented for me.”\r\n\r\nThe next moment Sir Miles’s thoughts had gone back to the recent\r\nepisode. So absorbed was he in his musings, that when the King presently\r\nhanded him the paper which he had been writing, he received it and\r\npocketed it without being conscious of the act. “How marvellous strange\r\nshe acted,” he muttered.  “I think she knew me--and I think she did\r\n_not_ know me. These opinions do conflict, I perceive it plainly; I\r\ncannot reconcile them, neither can I, by argument, dismiss either of the\r\ntwo, or even persuade one to outweigh the other.  The matter standeth\r\nsimply thus: she _must_ have known my face, my figure, my voice, for how\r\ncould it be otherwise?  Yet she __said_ _she knew me not, and that is\r\nproof perfect, for she cannot lie.  But stop--I think I begin to see.\r\nPeradventure he hath influenced her, commanded her, compelled her to\r\nlie.  That is the solution.  The riddle is unriddled.  She seemed dead\r\nwith fear--yes, she was under his compulsion.  I will seek her; I will\r\nfind her; now that he is away, she will speak her true mind.  She will\r\nremember the old times when we were little playfellows together, and\r\nthis will soften her heart, and she will no more betray me, but will\r\nconfess me.  There is no treacherous blood in her--no, she was always\r\nhonest and true.  She has loved me, in those old days--this is my\r\nsecurity; for whom one has loved, one cannot betray.”\r\n\r\nHe stepped eagerly toward the door; at that moment it opened, and the\r\nLady Edith entered.  She was very pale, but she walked with a firm step,\r\nand her carriage was full of grace and gentle dignity. Her face was as\r\nsad as before.\r\n\r\nMiles sprang forward, with a happy confidence, to meet her, but she\r\nchecked him with a hardly perceptible gesture, and he stopped where he\r\nwas.  She seated herself, and asked him to do likewise. Thus simply did\r\nshe take the sense of old comradeship out of him, and transform him\r\ninto a stranger and a guest.  The surprise of it, the bewildering\r\nunexpectedness of it, made him begin to question, for a moment, if he\r\n_was_ the person he was pretending to be, after all.  The Lady Edith\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n“Sir, I have come to warn you.  The mad cannot be persuaded out of\r\ntheir delusions, perchance; but doubtless they may be persuaded to avoid\r\nperils.  I think this dream of yours hath the seeming of honest truth to\r\nyou, and therefore is not criminal--but do not tarry here with it; for\r\nhere it is dangerous.”  She looked steadily into Miles’s face a moment,\r\nthen added, impressively, “It is the more dangerous for that you _are_\r\nmuch like what our lost lad must have grown to be if he had lived.”\r\n\r\n“Heavens, madam, but I _am_ he!”\r\n\r\n“I truly think you think it, sir.  I question not your honesty in that;\r\nI but warn you, that is all.  My husband is master in this region; his\r\npower hath hardly any limit; the people prosper or starve, as he wills.\r\nIf you resembled not the man whom you profess to be, my husband might\r\nbid you pleasure yourself with your dream in peace; but trust me, I know\r\nhim well; I know what he will do; he will say to all that you are but a\r\nmad impostor, and straightway all will echo him.”  She bent upon Miles\r\nthat same steady look once more, and added:  “If you _were_ Miles\r\nHendon, and he knew it and all the region knew it--consider what I\r\nam saying, weigh it well--you would stand in the same peril, your\r\npunishment would be no less sure; he would deny you and denounce you,\r\nand none would be bold enough to give you countenance.”\r\n\r\n“Most truly I believe it,” said Miles, bitterly.  “The power that\r\ncan command one life-long friend to betray and disown another, and be\r\nobeyed, may well look to be obeyed in quarters where bread and life are\r\non the stake and no cobweb ties of loyalty and honour are concerned.”\r\n\r\nA faint tinge appeared for a moment in the lady’s cheek, and she dropped\r\nher eyes to the floor; but her voice betrayed no emotion when she\r\nproceeded--\r\n\r\n“I have warned you--I must still warn you--to go hence.  This man will\r\ndestroy you, else.  He is a tyrant who knows no pity.  I, who am\r\nhis fettered slave, know this.  Poor Miles, and Arthur, and my dear\r\nguardian, Sir Richard, are free of him, and at rest:  better that\r\nyou were with them than that you bide here in the clutches of this\r\nmiscreant.  Your pretensions are a menace to his title and possessions;\r\nyou have assaulted him in his own house:  you are ruined if you stay.\r\n Go--do not hesitate. If you lack money, take this purse, I beg of you,\r\nand bribe the servants to let you pass. Oh, be warned, poor soul, and\r\nescape while you may.”\r\n\r\nMiles declined the purse with a gesture, and rose up and stood before\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“Grant me one thing,” he said.  “Let your eyes rest upon mine, so that I\r\nmay see if they be steady.  There--now answer me.  Am I Miles Hendon?”\r\n\r\n“No.  I know you not.”\r\n\r\n“Swear it!”\r\n\r\nThe answer was low, but distinct--\r\n\r\n“I swear.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, this passes belief!”\r\n\r\n“Fly!  Why will you waste the precious time?  Fly, and save yourself.”\r\n\r\nAt that moment the officers burst into the room, and a violent struggle\r\nbegan; but Hendon was soon overpowered and dragged away. The King was\r\ntaken also, and both were bound and led to prison.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII. In Prison.\r\n\r\nThe cells were all crowded; so the two friends were chained in a large\r\nroom where persons charged with trifling offences were commonly kept.\r\nThey had company, for there were some twenty manacled and fettered\r\nprisoners here, of both sexes and of varying ages,--an obscene and noisy\r\ngang.  The King chafed bitterly over the stupendous indignity thus put\r\nupon his royalty, but Hendon was moody and taciturn.  He was pretty\r\nthoroughly bewildered; he had come home, a jubilant prodigal, expecting\r\nto find everybody wild with joy over his return; and instead had got the\r\ncold shoulder and a jail.  The promise and the fulfilment differed so\r\nwidely that the effect was stunning; he could not decide whether it\r\nwas most tragic or most grotesque.  He felt much as a man might who had\r\ndanced blithely out to enjoy a rainbow, and got struck by lightning.\r\n\r\nBut gradually his confused and tormenting thoughts settled down into\r\nsome sort of order, and then his mind centred itself upon Edith.  He\r\nturned her conduct over, and examined it in all lights, but he could not\r\nmake anything satisfactory out of it.  Did she know him--or didn’t she\r\nknow him?  It was a perplexing puzzle, and occupied him a long time; but\r\nhe ended, finally, with the conviction that she did know him, and had\r\nrepudiated him for interested reasons.  He wanted to load her name with\r\ncurses now; but this name had so long been sacred to him that he found\r\nhe could not bring his tongue to profane it.\r\n\r\nWrapped in prison blankets of a soiled and tattered condition, Hendon\r\nand the King passed a troubled night.  For a bribe the jailer had\r\nfurnished liquor to some of the prisoners; singing of ribald songs,\r\nfighting, shouting, and carousing was the natural consequence.  At last,\r\na while after midnight, a man attacked a woman and nearly killed her by\r\nbeating her over the head with his manacles before the jailer could\r\ncome to the rescue.  The jailer restored peace by giving the man a sound\r\nclubbing about the head and shoulders--then the carousing ceased;\r\nand after that, all had an opportunity to sleep who did not mind the\r\nannoyance of the moanings and groanings of the two wounded people.\r\n\r\nDuring the ensuing week, the days and nights were of a monotonous\r\nsameness as to events; men whose faces Hendon remembered more or less\r\ndistinctly, came, by day, to gaze at the ‘impostor’ and repudiate\r\nand insult him; and by night the carousing and brawling went on with\r\nsymmetrical regularity.  However, there was a change of incident at\r\nlast. The jailer brought in an old man, and said to him--\r\n\r\n“The villain is in this room--cast thy old eyes about and see if thou\r\ncanst say which is he.”\r\n\r\nHendon glanced up, and experienced a pleasant sensation for the first\r\ntime since he had been in the jail.  He said to himself, “This is Blake\r\nAndrews, a servant all his life in my father’s family--a good honest\r\nsoul, with a right heart in his breast. That is, formerly.  But none are\r\ntrue now; all are liars.  This man will know me--and will deny me, too,\r\nlike the rest.”\r\n\r\nThe old man gazed around the room, glanced at each face in turn, and\r\nfinally said--\r\n\r\n“I see none here but paltry knaves, scum o’ the streets.  Which is he?”\r\n\r\nThe jailer laughed.\r\n\r\n“Here,” he said; “scan this big animal, and grant me an opinion.”\r\n\r\nThe old man approached, and looked Hendon over, long and earnestly, then\r\nshook his head and said--\r\n\r\n“Marry, _this_ is no Hendon--nor ever was!”\r\n\r\n“Right!  Thy old eyes are sound yet.  An’ I were Sir Hugh, I would take\r\nthe shabby carle and--”\r\n\r\nThe jailer finished by lifting himself a-tip-toe with an imaginary\r\nhalter, at the same time making a gurgling noise in his throat\r\nsuggestive of suffocation.  The old man said, vindictively--\r\n\r\n“Let him bless God an’ he fare no worse.  An’ _I_ had the handling o’\r\nthe villain he should roast, or I am no true man!”\r\n\r\nThe jailer laughed a pleasant hyena laugh, and said--\r\n\r\n“Give him a piece of thy mind, old man--they all do it.  Thou’lt find it\r\ngood diversion.”\r\n\r\nThen he sauntered toward his ante-room and disappeared.  The old man\r\ndropped upon his knees and whispered--\r\n\r\n“God be thanked, thou’rt come again, my master!  I believed thou wert\r\ndead these seven years, and lo, here thou art alive!  I knew thee the\r\nmoment I saw thee; and main hard work it was to keep a stony countenance\r\nand seem to see none here but tuppenny knaves and rubbish o’ the\r\nstreets. I am old and poor, Sir Miles; but say the word and I will go\r\nforth and proclaim the truth though I be strangled for it.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Hendon; “thou shalt not.  It would ruin thee, and yet help\r\nbut little in my cause.  But I thank thee, for thou hast given me back\r\nsomewhat of my lost faith in my kind.”\r\n\r\nThe old servant became very valuable to Hendon and the King; for\r\nhe dropped in several times a day to ‘abuse’ the former, and always\r\nsmuggled in a few delicacies to help out the prison bill of fare; he\r\nalso furnished the current news.  Hendon reserved the dainties for the\r\nKing; without them his Majesty might not have survived, for he was\r\nnot able to eat the coarse and wretched food provided by the jailer.\r\n Andrews was obliged to confine himself to brief visits, in order to\r\navoid suspicion; but he managed to impart a fair degree of information\r\neach time--information delivered in a low voice, for Hendon’s benefit,\r\nand interlarded with insulting epithets delivered in a louder voice for\r\nthe benefit of other hearers.\r\n\r\nSo, little by little, the story of the family came out.  Arthur had\r\nbeen dead six years.  This loss, with the absence of news from Hendon,\r\nimpaired the father’s health; he believed he was going to die, and he\r\nwished to see Hugh and Edith settled in life before he passed away; but\r\nEdith begged hard for delay, hoping for Miles’s return; then the letter\r\ncame which brought the news of Miles’s death; the shock prostrated Sir\r\nRichard; he believed his end was very near, and he and Hugh insisted\r\nupon the marriage; Edith begged for and obtained a month’s respite,\r\nthen another, and finally a third; the marriage then took place by\r\nthe death-bed of Sir Richard.  It had not proved a happy one.  It was\r\nwhispered about the country that shortly after the nuptials the bride\r\nfound among her husband’s papers several rough and incomplete drafts of\r\nthe fatal letter, and had accused him of precipitating the marriage--and\r\nSir Richard’s death, too--by a wicked forgery. Tales of cruelty to the\r\nLady Edith and the servants were to be heard on all hands; and since the\r\nfather’s death Sir Hugh had thrown off all soft disguises and become\r\na pitiless master toward all who in any way depended upon him and his\r\ndomains for bread.\r\n\r\nThere was a bit of Andrew’s gossip which the King listened to with a\r\nlively interest--\r\n\r\n“There is rumour that the King is mad.  But in charity forbear to say\r\n_I_ mentioned it, for ’tis death to speak of it, they say.”\r\n\r\nHis Majesty glared at the old man and said--\r\n\r\n“The King is _not_ mad, good man--and thou’lt find it to thy advantage\r\nto busy thyself with matters that nearer concern thee than this\r\nseditious prattle.”\r\n\r\n“What doth the lad mean?” said Andrews, surprised at this brisk assault\r\nfrom such an unexpected quarter.  Hendon gave him a sign, and he did not\r\npursue his question, but went on with his budget--\r\n\r\n“The late King is to be buried at Windsor in a day or two--the 16th of\r\nthe month--and the new King will be crowned at Westminster the 20th.”\r\n\r\n“Methinks they must needs find him first,” muttered his Majesty; then\r\nadded, confidently, “but they will look to that--and so also shall I.”\r\n\r\n“In the name of--”\r\n\r\nBut the old man got no further--a warning sign from Hendon checked his\r\nremark.  He resumed the thread of his gossip--\r\n\r\n“Sir Hugh goeth to the coronation--and with grand hopes.  He confidently\r\nlooketh to come back a peer, for he is high in favour with the Lord\r\nProtector.”\r\n\r\n“What Lord Protector?” asked his Majesty.\r\n\r\n“His Grace the Duke of Somerset.”\r\n\r\n“What Duke of Somerset?”\r\n\r\n“Marry, there is but one--Seymour, Earl of Hertford.”\r\n\r\nThe King asked sharply--\r\n\r\n“Since when is _he_ a duke, and Lord Protector?”\r\n\r\n“Since the last day of January.”\r\n\r\n“And prithee who made him so?”\r\n\r\n“Himself and the Great Council--with help of the King.”\r\n\r\nHis Majesty started violently.  “The _King_!” he cried.  “_What_ king,\r\ngood sir?”\r\n\r\n“What king, indeed! (God-a-mercy, what aileth the boy?)  Sith we have\r\nbut one, ’tis not difficult to answer--his most sacred Majesty King\r\nEdward the Sixth--whom God preserve!  Yea, and a dear and gracious\r\nlittle urchin is he, too; and whether he be mad or no--and they say he\r\nmendeth daily--his praises are on all men’s lips; and all bless him,\r\nlikewise, and offer prayers that he may be spared to reign long in\r\nEngland; for he began humanely with saving the old Duke of Norfolk’s\r\nlife, and now is he bent on destroying the cruellest of the laws that\r\nharry and oppress the people.”\r\n\r\nThis news struck his Majesty dumb with amazement, and plunged him into\r\nso deep and dismal a reverie that he heard no more of the old man’s\r\ngossip. He wondered if the ‘little urchin’ was the beggar-boy whom\r\nhe left dressed in his own garments in the palace.  It did not seem\r\npossible that this could be, for surely his manners and speech would\r\nbetray him if he pretended to be the Prince of Wales--then he would be\r\ndriven out, and search made for the true prince.  Could it be that the\r\nCourt had set up some sprig of the nobility in his place?  No, for his\r\nuncle would not allow that--he was all-powerful and could and would\r\ncrush such a movement, of course.  The boy’s musings profited him\r\nnothing; the more he tried to unriddle the mystery the more perplexed he\r\nbecame, the more his head ached, and the worse he slept.  His\r\nimpatience to get to London grew hourly, and his captivity became almost\r\nunendurable.\r\n\r\nHendon’s arts all failed with the King--he could not be comforted; but a\r\ncouple of women who were chained near him succeeded better. Under their\r\ngentle ministrations he found peace and learned a degree of patience.\r\n He was very grateful, and came to love them dearly and to delight in\r\nthe sweet and soothing influence of their presence.  He asked them why\r\nthey were in prison, and when they said they were Baptists, he smiled,\r\nand inquired--\r\n\r\n“Is that a crime to be shut up for in a prison?  Now I grieve, for I\r\nshall lose ye--they will not keep ye long for such a little thing.”\r\n\r\nThey did not answer; and something in their faces made him uneasy. He\r\nsaid, eagerly--\r\n\r\n“You do not speak; be good to me, and tell me--there will be no other\r\npunishment?  Prithee tell me there is no fear of that.”\r\n\r\nThey tried to change the topic, but his fears were aroused, and he\r\npursued it--\r\n\r\n“Will they scourge thee?  No, no, they would not be so cruel!  Say they\r\nwould not.  Come, they _will_ not, will they?”\r\n\r\nThe women betrayed confusion and distress, but there was no avoiding an\r\nanswer, so one of them said, in a voice choked with emotion--\r\n\r\n“Oh, thou’lt break our hearts, thou gentle spirit!--God will help us to\r\nbear our--”\r\n\r\n“It is a confession!” the King broke in.  “Then they _will_ scourge\r\nthee, the stony-hearted wretches!  But oh, thou must not weep, I cannot\r\nbear it.  Keep up thy courage--I shall come to my own in time to save\r\nthee from this bitter thing, and I will do it!”\r\n\r\nWhen the King awoke in the morning, the women were gone.\r\n\r\n“They are saved!” he said, joyfully; then added, despondently, “but woe\r\nis me!--for they were my comforters.”\r\n\r\nEach of them had left a shred of ribbon pinned to his clothing, in token\r\nof remembrance.  He said he would keep these things always; and that\r\nsoon he would seek out these dear good friends of his and take them\r\nunder his protection.\r\n\r\nJust then the jailer came in with some subordinates, and commanded that\r\nthe prisoners be conducted to the jail-yard.  The King was overjoyed--it\r\nwould be a blessed thing to see the blue sky and breathe the fresh air\r\nonce more.  He fretted and chafed at the slowness of the officers, but\r\nhis turn came at last, and he was released from his staple and ordered\r\nto follow the other prisoners with Hendon.\r\n\r\nThe court or quadrangle was stone-paved, and open to the sky.  The\r\nprisoners entered it through a massive archway of masonry, and were\r\nplaced in file, standing, with their backs against the wall. A rope\r\nwas stretched in front of them, and they were also guarded by their\r\nofficers. It was a chill and lowering morning, and a light snow which\r\nhad fallen during the night whitened the great empty space and added\r\nto the general dismalness of its aspect. Now and then a wintry wind\r\nshivered through the place and sent the snow eddying hither and thither.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the court stood two women, chained to posts.  A glance\r\nshowed the King that these were his good friends.  He shuddered, and\r\nsaid to himself, “Alack, they are not gone free, as I had thought.  To\r\nthink that such as these should know the lash!--in England!  Ay, there’s\r\nthe shame of it--not in Heathennesse, Christian England!  They will be\r\nscourged; and I, whom they have comforted and kindly entreated, must\r\nlook on and see the great wrong done; it is strange, so strange, that\r\nI, the very source of power in this broad realm, am helpless to protect\r\nthem. But let these miscreants look well to themselves, for there is a\r\nday coming when I will require of them a heavy reckoning for this work.\r\n For every blow they strike now, they shall feel a hundred then.”\r\n\r\nA great gate swung open, and a crowd of citizens poured in.  They\r\nflocked around the two women, and hid them from the King’s view. A\r\nclergyman entered and passed through the crowd, and he also was hidden.\r\n The King now heard talking, back and forth, as if questions were being\r\nasked and answered, but he could not make out what was said.  Next there\r\nwas a deal of bustle and preparation, and much passing and repassing of\r\nofficials through that part of the crowd that stood on the further side\r\nof the women; and whilst this proceeded a deep hush gradually fell upon\r\nthe people.\r\n\r\nNow, by command, the masses parted and fell aside, and the King saw a\r\nspectacle that froze the marrow in his bones.  Faggots had been piled\r\nabout the two women, and a kneeling man was lighting them!\r\n\r\nThe women bowed their heads, and covered their faces with their hands;\r\nthe yellow flames began to climb upward among the snapping and crackling\r\nfaggots, and wreaths of blue smoke to stream away on the wind; the\r\nclergyman lifted his hands and began a prayer--just then two young girls\r\ncame flying through the great gate, uttering piercing screams, and threw\r\nthemselves upon the women at the stake.  Instantly they were torn away\r\nby the officers, and one of them was kept in a tight grip, but the other\r\nbroke loose, saying she would die with her mother; and before she could\r\nbe stopped she had flung her arms about her mother’s neck again.  She\r\nwas torn away once more, and with her gown on fire.  Two or three men\r\nheld her, and the burning portion of her gown was snatched off and\r\nthrown flaming aside, she struggling all the while to free herself, and\r\nsaying she would be alone in the world, now; and begging to be allowed\r\nto die with her mother.  Both the girls screamed continually, and fought\r\nfor freedom; but suddenly this tumult was drowned under a volley of\r\nheart-piercing shrieks of mortal agony--the King glanced from the\r\nfrantic girls to the stake, then turned away and leaned his ashen face\r\nagainst the wall, and looked no more.  He said, “That which I have seen,\r\nin that one little moment, will never go out from my memory, but will\r\nabide there; and I shall see it all the days, and dream of it all the\r\nnights, till I die.  Would God I had been blind!”\r\n\r\nHendon was watching the King.  He said to himself, with satisfaction,\r\n“His disorder mendeth; he hath changed, and groweth gentler.  If he had\r\nfollowed his wont, he would have stormed at these varlets, and said he\r\nwas King, and commanded that the women be turned loose unscathed.  Soon\r\nhis delusion will pass away and be forgotten, and his poor mind will be\r\nwhole again.  God speed the day!”\r\n\r\nThat same day several prisoners were brought in to remain over night,\r\nwho were being conveyed, under guard, to various places in the kingdom,\r\nto undergo punishment for crimes committed.  The King conversed with\r\nthese--he had made it a point, from the beginning, to instruct himself\r\nfor the kingly office by questioning prisoners whenever the opportunity\r\noffered--and the tale of their woes wrung his heart.  One of them was\r\na poor half-witted woman who had stolen a yard or two of cloth from a\r\nweaver--she was to be hanged for it.  Another was a man who had been\r\naccused of stealing a horse; he said the proof had failed, and he had\r\nimagined that he was safe from the halter; but no--he was hardly free\r\nbefore he was arraigned for killing a deer in the King’s park; this was\r\nproved against him, and now he was on his way to the gallows.  There was\r\na tradesman’s apprentice whose case particularly distressed the King;\r\nthis youth said he found a hawk, one evening, that had escaped from its\r\nowner, and he took it home with him, imagining himself entitled to it;\r\nbut the court convicted him of stealing it, and sentenced him to death.\r\n\r\nThe King was furious over these inhumanities, and wanted Hendon to break\r\njail and fly with him to Westminster, so that he could mount his throne\r\nand hold out his sceptre in mercy over these unfortunate people and\r\nsave their lives.  “Poor child,” sighed Hendon, “these woeful tales\r\nhave brought his malady upon him again; alack, but for this evil hap, he\r\nwould have been well in a little time.”\r\n\r\nAmong these prisoners was an old lawyer--a man with a strong face and a\r\ndauntless mien.  Three years past, he had written a pamphlet against the\r\nLord Chancellor, accusing him of injustice, and had been punished for\r\nit by the loss of his ears in the pillory, and degradation from the\r\nbar, and in addition had been fined 3,000 pounds and sentenced to\r\nimprisonment for life.  Lately he had repeated his offence; and in\r\nconsequence was now under sentence to lose _what remained of his ears_,\r\npay a fine of 5,000 pounds, be branded on both cheeks, and remain in\r\nprison for life.\r\n\r\n“These be honourable scars,” he said, and turned back his grey hair and\r\nshowed the mutilated stubs of what had once been his ears.\r\n\r\nThe King’s eye burned with passion.  He said--\r\n\r\n“None believe in me--neither wilt thou.  But no matter--within the\r\ncompass of a month thou shalt be free; and more, the laws that have\r\ndishonoured thee, and shamed the English name, shall be swept from the\r\nstatute books.  The world is made wrong; kings should go to school to\r\ntheir own laws, at times, and so learn mercy.” {1}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII. The sacrifice.\r\n\r\nMeantime Miles was growing sufficiently tired of confinement and\r\ninaction.  But now his trial came on, to his great gratification, and\r\nhe thought he could welcome any sentence provided a further imprisonment\r\nshould not be a part of it.  But he was mistaken about that.  He was in\r\na fine fury when he found himself described as a ‘sturdy vagabond’ and\r\nsentenced to sit two hours in the stocks for bearing that character\r\nand for assaulting the master of Hendon Hall.  His pretensions as to\r\nbrothership with his prosecutor, and rightful heirship to the Hendon\r\nhonours and estates, were left contemptuously unnoticed, as being not\r\neven worth examination.\r\n\r\nHe raged and threatened on his way to punishment, but it did no good; he\r\nwas snatched roughly along by the officers, and got an occasional cuff,\r\nbesides, for his irreverent conduct.\r\n\r\nThe King could not pierce through the rabble that swarmed behind; so\r\nhe was obliged to follow in the rear, remote from his good friend and\r\nservant.  The King had been nearly condemned to the stocks himself for\r\nbeing in such bad company, but had been let off with a lecture and a\r\nwarning, in consideration of his youth.  When the crowd at last halted,\r\nhe flitted feverishly from point to point around its outer rim, hunting\r\na place to get through; and at last, after a deal of difficulty and\r\ndelay, succeeded.  There sat his poor henchman in the degrading stocks,\r\nthe sport and butt of a dirty mob--he, the body servant of the King\r\nof England!  Edward had heard the sentence pronounced, but he had not\r\nrealised the half that it meant.  His anger began to rise as the sense\r\nof this new indignity which had been put upon him sank home; it jumped\r\nto summer heat, the next moment, when he saw an egg sail through the air\r\nand crush itself against Hendon’s cheek, and heard the crowd roar\r\nits enjoyment of the episode.  He sprang across the open circle and\r\nconfronted the officer in charge, crying--\r\n\r\n“For shame!  This is my servant--set him free!  I am the--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, peace!” exclaimed Hendon, in a panic, “thou’lt destroy thyself.\r\nMind him not, officer, he is mad.”\r\n\r\n“Give thyself no trouble as to the matter of minding him, good man, I\r\nhave small mind to mind him; but as to teaching him somewhat, to that\r\nI am well inclined.”  He turned to a subordinate and said, “Give the\r\nlittle fool a taste or two of the lash, to mend his manners.”\r\n\r\n“Half a dozen will better serve his turn,” suggested Sir Hugh, who had\r\nridden up, a moment before, to take a passing glance at the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe King was seized.  He did not even struggle, so paralysed was he\r\nwith the mere thought of the monstrous outrage that was proposed to be\r\ninflicted upon his sacred person.  History was already defiled with\r\nthe record of the scourging of an English king with whips--it was an\r\nintolerable reflection that he must furnish a duplicate of that shameful\r\npage.  He was in the toils, there was no help for him; he must either\r\ntake this punishment or beg for its remission.  Hard conditions; he\r\nwould take the stripes--a king might do that, but a king could not beg.\r\n\r\nBut meantime, Miles Hendon was resolving the difficulty.  “Let the child\r\ngo,” said he; “ye heartless dogs, do ye not see how young and frail he\r\nis?  Let him go--I will take his lashes.”\r\n\r\n“Marry, a good thought--and thanks for it,” said Sir Hugh, his face\r\nlighting with a sardonic satisfaction.  “Let the little beggar go, and\r\ngive this fellow a dozen in his place--an honest dozen, well laid on.”\r\n The King was in the act of entering a fierce protest, but Sir Hugh\r\nsilenced him with the potent remark, “Yes, speak up, do, and free thy\r\nmind--only, mark ye, that for each word you utter he shall get six\r\nstrokes the more.”\r\n\r\nHendon was removed from the stocks, and his back laid bare; and whilst\r\nthe lash was applied the poor little King turned away his face and\r\nallowed unroyal tears to channel his cheeks unchecked. “Ah, brave good\r\nheart,” he said to himself, “this loyal deed shall never perish out of\r\nmy memory.  I will not forget it--and neither shall _they_!” he added,\r\nwith passion.  Whilst he mused, his appreciation of Hendon’s magnanimous\r\nconduct grew to greater and still greater dimensions in his mind, and\r\nso also did his gratefulness for it.  Presently he said to himself, “Who\r\nsaves his prince from wounds and possible death--and this he did for\r\nme--performs high service; but it is little--it is nothing--oh, less\r\nthan nothing!--when ’tis weighed against the act of him who saves his\r\nprince from _shame_!”\r\n\r\nHendon made no outcry under the scourge, but bore the heavy blows with\r\nsoldierly fortitude.  This, together with his redeeming the boy by\r\ntaking his stripes for him, compelled the respect of even that forlorn\r\nand degraded mob that was gathered there; and its gibes and hootings\r\ndied away, and no sound remained but the sound of the falling blows.\r\n The stillness that pervaded the place, when Hendon found himself once\r\nmore in the stocks, was in strong contrast with the insulting clamour\r\nwhich had prevailed there so little a while before.  The King came\r\nsoftly to Hendon’s side, and whispered in his ear--\r\n\r\n“Kings cannot ennoble thee, thou good, great soul, for One who is higher\r\nthan kings hath done that for thee; but a king can confirm thy nobility\r\nto men.”  He picked up the scourge from the ground, touched Hendon’s\r\nbleeding shoulders lightly with it, and whispered, “Edward of England\r\ndubs thee Earl!”\r\n\r\nHendon was touched.  The water welled to his eyes, yet at the same time\r\nthe grisly humour of the situation and circumstances so undermined his\r\ngravity that it was all he could do to keep some sign of his inward\r\nmirth from showing outside.  To be suddenly hoisted, naked and gory,\r\nfrom the common stocks to the Alpine altitude and splendour of\r\nan Earldom, seemed to him the last possibility in the line of the\r\ngrotesque.  He said to himself, “Now am I finely tinselled, indeed!\r\n The spectre-knight of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows is become a\r\nspectre-earl--a dizzy flight for a callow wing!  An’ this go on, I\r\nshall presently be hung like a very maypole with fantastic gauds and\r\nmake-believe honours.  But I shall value them, all valueless as\r\nthey are, for the love that doth bestow them. Better these poor mock\r\ndignities of mine, that come unasked, from a clean hand and a right\r\nspirit, than real ones bought by servility from grudging and interested\r\npower.”\r\n\r\nThe dreaded Sir Hugh wheeled his horse about, and as he spurred away,\r\nthe living wall divided silently to let him pass, and as silently closed\r\ntogether again.  And so remained; nobody went so far as to venture\r\na remark in favour of the prisoner, or in compliment to him; but no\r\nmatter--the absence of abuse was a sufficient homage in itself.  A\r\nlate comer who was not posted as to the present circumstances, and who\r\ndelivered a sneer at the ‘impostor,’ and was in the act of following it\r\nwith a dead cat, was promptly knocked down and kicked out, without any\r\nwords, and then the deep quiet resumed sway once more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX. To London.\r\n\r\nWhen Hendon’s term of service in the stocks was finished, he was\r\nreleased and ordered to quit the region and come back no more. His sword\r\nwas restored to him, and also his mule and his donkey. He mounted\r\nand rode off, followed by the King, the crowd opening with quiet\r\nrespectfulness to let them pass, and then dispersing when they were\r\ngone.\r\n\r\nHendon was soon absorbed in thought.  There were questions of high\r\nimport to be answered.  What should he do?  Whither should he go?\r\nPowerful help must be found somewhere, or he must relinquish his\r\ninheritance and remain under the imputation of being an impostor\r\nbesides.  Where could he hope to find this powerful help?  Where,\r\nindeed!  It was a knotty question. By-and-by a thought occurred to him\r\nwhich pointed to a possibility--the slenderest of slender possibilities,\r\ncertainly, but still worth considering, for lack of any other that\r\npromised anything at all.  He remembered what old Andrews had said about\r\nthe young King’s goodness and his generous championship of the wronged\r\nand unfortunate.  Why not go and try to get speech of him and beg for\r\njustice?  Ah, yes, but could so fantastic a pauper get admission to the\r\naugust presence of a monarch? Never mind--let that matter take care of\r\nitself; it was a bridge that would not need to be crossed till he should\r\ncome to it.  He was an old campaigner, and used to inventing shifts and\r\nexpedients:  no doubt he would be able to find a way.  Yes, he would\r\nstrike for the capital. Maybe his father’s old friend Sir Humphrey\r\nMarlow would help him--‘good old Sir Humphrey, Head Lieutenant of the\r\nlate King’s kitchen, or stables, or something’--Miles could not remember\r\njust what or which.  Now that he had something to turn his energies to,\r\na distinctly defined object to accomplish, the fog of humiliation and\r\ndepression which had settled down upon his spirits lifted and blew away,\r\nand he raised his head and looked about him.  He was surprised to see\r\nhow far he had come; the village was away behind him.  The King was\r\njogging along in his wake, with his head bowed; for he, too, was deep\r\nin plans and thinkings.  A sorrowful misgiving clouded Hendon’s new-born\r\ncheerfulness:  would the boy be willing to go again to a city where,\r\nduring all his brief life, he had never known anything but ill-usage and\r\npinching want?  But the question must be asked; it could not be avoided;\r\nso Hendon reined up, and called out--\r\n\r\n“I had forgotten to inquire whither we are bound.  Thy commands, my\r\nliege!”\r\n\r\n“To London!”\r\n\r\nHendon moved on again, mightily contented with the answer--but astounded\r\nat it too.\r\n\r\nThe whole journey was made without an adventure of importance. But it\r\nended with one.  About ten o’clock on the night of the 19th of February\r\nthey stepped upon London Bridge, in the midst of a writhing, struggling\r\njam of howling and hurrahing people, whose beer-jolly faces stood out\r\nstrongly in the glare from manifold torches--and at that instant the\r\ndecaying head of some former duke or other grandee tumbled down between\r\nthem, striking Hendon on the elbow and then bounding off among the\r\nhurrying confusion of feet. So evanescent and unstable are men’s works\r\nin this world!--the late good King is but three weeks dead and three\r\ndays in his grave, and already the adornments which he took such pains\r\nto select from prominent people for his noble bridge are falling.  A\r\ncitizen stumbled over that head, and drove his own head into the back of\r\nsomebody in front of him, who turned and knocked down the first person\r\nthat came handy, and was promptly laid out himself by that person’s\r\nfriend.  It was the right ripe time for a free fight, for the\r\nfestivities of the morrow--Coronation Day--were already beginning;\r\neverybody was full of strong drink and patriotism; within five minutes\r\nthe free fight was occupying a good deal of ground; within ten or twelve\r\nit covered an acre of so, and was become a riot.  By this time Hendon\r\nand the King were hopelessly separated from each other and lost in the\r\nrush and turmoil of the roaring masses of humanity.  And so we leave\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX. Tom’s progress.\r\n\r\nWhilst the true King wandered about the land poorly clad, poorly\r\nfed, cuffed and derided by tramps one while, herding with thieves\r\nand murderers in a jail another, and called idiot and impostor by\r\nall impartially, the mock King Tom Canty enjoyed quite a different\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nWhen we saw him last, royalty was just beginning to have a bright side\r\nfor him.  This bright side went on brightening more and more every\r\nday: in a very little while it was become almost all sunshine and\r\ndelightfulness.  He lost his fears; his misgivings faded out and died;\r\nhis embarrassments departed, and gave place to an easy and confident\r\nbearing.  He worked the whipping-boy mine to ever-increasing profit.\r\n\r\nHe ordered my Lady Elizabeth and my Lady Jane Grey into his presence\r\nwhen he wanted to play or talk, and dismissed them when he was done with\r\nthem, with the air of one familiarly accustomed to such performances.\r\n It no longer confused him to have these lofty personages kiss his hand\r\nat parting.\r\n\r\nHe came to enjoy being conducted to bed in state at night, and dressed\r\nwith intricate and solemn ceremony in the morning.  It came to be a\r\nproud pleasure to march to dinner attended by a glittering procession\r\nof officers of state and gentlemen-at-arms; insomuch, indeed, that he\r\ndoubled his guard of gentlemen-at-arms, and made them a hundred.  He\r\nliked to hear the bugles sounding down the long corridors, and the\r\ndistant voices responding, “Way for the King!”\r\n\r\nHe even learned to enjoy sitting in throned state in council, and\r\nseeming to be something more than the Lord Protector’s mouthpiece. He\r\nliked to receive great ambassadors and their gorgeous trains, and listen\r\nto the affectionate messages they brought from illustrious monarchs who\r\ncalled him brother.  O happy Tom Canty, late of Offal Court!\r\n\r\nHe enjoyed his splendid clothes, and ordered more:  he found his four\r\nhundred servants too few for his proper grandeur, and trebled them.  The\r\nadulation of salaaming courtiers came to be sweet music to his ears.  He\r\nremained kind and gentle, and a sturdy and determined champion of all\r\nthat were oppressed, and he made tireless war upon unjust laws:  yet\r\nupon occasion, being offended, he could turn upon an earl, or even a\r\nduke, and give him a look that would make him tremble.  Once, when his\r\nroyal ‘sister,’ the grimly holy Lady Mary, set herself to reason with\r\nhim against the wisdom of his course in pardoning so many people who\r\nwould otherwise be jailed, or hanged, or burned, and reminded him that\r\ntheir august late father’s prisons had sometimes contained as high as\r\nsixty thousand convicts at one time, and that during his admirable reign\r\nhe had delivered seventy-two thousand thieves and robbers over to death\r\nby the executioner, {9} the boy was filled with generous indignation,\r\nand commanded her to go to her closet, and beseech God to take away the\r\nstone that was in her breast, and give her a human heart.\r\n\r\nDid Tom Canty never feel troubled about the poor little rightful prince\r\nwho had treated him so kindly, and flown out with such hot zeal to\r\navenge him upon the insolent sentinel at the palace-gate? Yes; his first\r\nroyal days and nights were pretty well sprinkled with painful thoughts\r\nabout the lost prince, and with sincere longings for his return, and\r\nhappy restoration to his native rights and splendours.  But as time\r\nwore on, and the prince did not come, Tom’s mind became more and more\r\noccupied with his new and enchanting experiences, and by little and\r\nlittle the vanished monarch faded almost out of his thoughts; and\r\nfinally, when he did intrude upon them at intervals, he was become an\r\nunwelcome spectre, for he made Tom feel guilty and ashamed.\r\n\r\nTom’s poor mother and sisters travelled the same road out of his mind.\r\nAt first he pined for them, sorrowed for them, longed to see them, but\r\nlater, the thought of their coming some day in their rags and dirt, and\r\nbetraying him with their kisses, and pulling him down from his lofty\r\nplace, and dragging him back to penury and degradation and the slums,\r\nmade him shudder.  At last they ceased to trouble his thoughts almost\r\nwholly.  And he was content, even glad:  for, whenever their mournful\r\nand accusing faces did rise before him now, they made him feel more\r\ndespicable than the worms that crawl.\r\n\r\nAt midnight of the 19th of February, Tom Canty was sinking to sleep in\r\nhis rich bed in the palace, guarded by his loyal vassals, and surrounded\r\nby the pomps of royalty, a happy boy; for tomorrow was the day appointed\r\nfor his solemn crowning as King of England. At that same hour, Edward,\r\nthe true king, hungry and thirsty, soiled and draggled, worn with\r\ntravel, and clothed in rags and shreds--his share of the results of the\r\nriot--was wedged in among a crowd of people who were watching with deep\r\ninterest certain hurrying gangs of workmen who streamed in and out of\r\nWestminster Abbey, busy as ants:  they were making the last preparation\r\nfor the royal coronation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI. The Recognition procession.\r\n\r\nWhen Tom Canty awoke the next morning, the air was heavy with a\r\nthunderous murmur:  all the distances were charged with it.  It was\r\nmusic to him; for it meant that the English world was out in its\r\nstrength to give loyal welcome to the great day.\r\n\r\nPresently Tom found himself once more the chief figure in a wonderful\r\nfloating pageant on the Thames; for by ancient custom the ‘recognition\r\nprocession’ through London must start from the Tower, and he was bound\r\nthither.\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived there, the sides of the venerable fortress seemed\r\nsuddenly rent in a thousand places, and from every rent leaped a\r\nred tongue of flame and a white gush of smoke; a deafening explosion\r\nfollowed, which drowned the shoutings of the multitude, and made the\r\nground tremble; the flame-jets, the smoke, and the explosions, were\r\nrepeated over and over again with marvellous celerity, so that in a few\r\nmoments the old Tower disappeared in the vast fog of its own smoke, all\r\nbut the very top of the tall pile called the White Tower; this, with\r\nits banners, stood out above the dense bank of vapour as a mountain-peak\r\nprojects above a cloud-rack.\r\n\r\nTom Canty, splendidly arrayed, mounted a prancing war-steed, whose rich\r\ntrappings almost reached to the ground; his ‘uncle,’ the Lord Protector\r\nSomerset, similarly mounted, took place in his rear; the King’s Guard\r\nformed in single ranks on either side, clad in burnished armour;\r\nafter the Protector followed a seemingly interminable procession of\r\nresplendent nobles attended by their vassals; after these came the lord\r\nmayor and the aldermanic body, in crimson velvet robes, and with their\r\ngold chains across their breasts; and after these the officers and\r\nmembers of all the guilds of London, in rich raiment, and bearing the\r\nshowy banners of the several corporations.  Also in the procession, as a\r\nspecial guard of honour through the city, was the Ancient and Honourable\r\nArtillery Company--an organisation already three hundred years old\r\nat that time, and the only military body in England possessing the\r\nprivilege (which it still possesses in our day) of holding itself\r\nindependent of the commands of Parliament.  It was a brilliant\r\nspectacle, and was hailed with acclamations all along the line, as it\r\ntook its stately way through the packed multitudes of citizens. The\r\nchronicler says, ‘The King, as he entered the city, was received by the\r\npeople with prayers, welcomings, cries, and tender words, and all signs\r\nwhich argue an earnest love of subjects toward their sovereign; and the\r\nKing, by holding up his glad countenance to such as stood afar off, and\r\nmost tender language to those that stood nigh his Grace, showed himself\r\nno less thankful to receive the people’s goodwill than they to offer it.\r\n To all that wished him well, he gave thanks.  To such as bade “God save\r\nhis Grace,” he said in return, “God save you all!” and added that “he\r\nthanked them with all his heart.” Wonderfully transported were the\r\npeople with the loving answers and gestures of their King.’\r\n\r\nIn Fenchurch Street a ‘fair child, in costly apparel,’ stood on a stage\r\nto welcome his Majesty to the city.  The last verse of his greeting was\r\nin these words--\r\n\r\n‘Welcome, O King! as much as hearts can think; Welcome, again, as much\r\nas tongue can tell,--Welcome to joyous tongues, and hearts that will\r\nnot shrink: God thee preserve, we pray, and wish thee ever well.’\r\n\r\nThe people burst forth in a glad shout, repeating with one voice what\r\nthe child had said.  Tom Canty gazed abroad over the surging sea of\r\neager faces, and his heart swelled with exultation; and he felt that\r\nthe one thing worth living for in this world was to be a king, and a\r\nnation’s idol.  Presently he caught sight, at a distance, of a couple\r\nof his ragged Offal Court comrades--one of them the lord high admiral in\r\nhis late mimic court, the other the first lord of the bedchamber in the\r\nsame pretentious fiction; and his pride swelled higher than ever.  Oh,\r\nif they could only recognise him now!  What unspeakable glory it would\r\nbe, if they could recognise him, and realise that the derided mock king\r\nof the slums and back alleys was become a real King, with illustrious\r\ndukes and princes for his humble menials, and the English world at his\r\nfeet!  But he had to deny himself, and choke down his desire, for such\r\na recognition might cost more than it would come to:  so he turned away\r\nhis head, and left the two soiled lads to go on with their shoutings and\r\nglad adulations, unsuspicious of whom it was they were lavishing them\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then rose the cry, “A largess! a largess!” and Tom\r\nresponded by scattering a handful of bright new coins abroad for the\r\nmultitude to scramble for.\r\n\r\nThe chronicler says, ‘At the upper end of Gracechurch Street, before the\r\nsign of the Eagle, the city had erected a gorgeous arch, beneath which\r\nwas a stage, which stretched from one side of the street to the other.\r\nThis was an historical pageant, representing the King’s immediate\r\nprogenitors.  There sat Elizabeth of York in the midst of an immense\r\nwhite rose, whose petals formed elaborate furbelows around her; by her\r\nside was Henry VII., issuing out of a vast red rose, disposed in the\r\nsame manner:  the hands of the royal pair were locked together, and the\r\nwedding-ring ostentatiously displayed.  From the red and white roses\r\nproceeded a stem, which reached up to a second stage, occupied by Henry\r\nVIII., issuing from a red and white rose, with the effigy of the new\r\nKing’s mother, Jane Seymour, represented by his side.  One branch sprang\r\nfrom this pair, which mounted to a third stage, where sat the effigy of\r\nEdward VI. himself, enthroned in royal majesty; and the whole pageant\r\nwas framed with wreaths of roses, red and white.’\r\n\r\nThis quaint and gaudy spectacle so wrought upon the rejoicing people,\r\nthat their acclamations utterly smothered the small voice of the child\r\nwhose business it was to explain the thing in eulogistic rhymes.  But\r\nTom Canty was not sorry; for this loyal uproar was sweeter music to him\r\nthan any poetry, no matter what its quality might be.  Whithersoever Tom\r\nturned his happy young face, the people recognised the exactness of his\r\neffigy’s likeness to himself, the flesh and blood counterpart; and new\r\nwhirlwinds of applause burst forth.\r\n\r\nThe great pageant moved on, and still on, under one triumphal arch after\r\nanother, and past a bewildering succession of spectacular and symbolical\r\ntableaux, each of which typified and exalted some virtue, or talent, or\r\nmerit, of the little King’s.  ‘Throughout the whole of Cheapside, from\r\nevery penthouse and window, hung banners and streamers; and the richest\r\ncarpets, stuffs, and cloth-of-gold tapestried the streets--specimens\r\nof the great wealth of the stores within; and the splendour of this\r\nthoroughfare was equalled in the other streets, and in some even\r\nsurpassed.’\r\n\r\n“And all these wonders and these marvels are to welcome me--me!”\r\n murmured Tom Canty.\r\n\r\nThe mock King’s cheeks were flushed with excitement, his eyes were\r\nflashing, his senses swam in a delirium of pleasure.  At this point,\r\njust as he was raising his hand to fling another rich largess, he caught\r\nsight of a pale, astounded face, which was strained forward out of\r\nthe second rank of the crowd, its intense eyes riveted upon him.  A\r\nsickening consternation struck through him; he recognised his\r\nmother! and up flew his hand, palm outward, before his eyes--that old\r\ninvoluntary gesture, born of a forgotten episode, and perpetuated by\r\nhabit.  In an instant more she had torn her way out of the press, and\r\npast the guards, and was at his side.  She embraced his leg, she covered\r\nit with kisses, she cried, “O my child, my darling!” lifting toward him\r\na face that was transfigured with joy and love.  The same instant an\r\nofficer of the King’s Guard snatched her away with a curse, and sent\r\nher reeling back whence she came with a vigorous impulse from his\r\nstrong arm.  The words “I do not know you, woman!” were falling from Tom\r\nCanty’s lips when this piteous thing occurred; but it smote him to the\r\nheart to see her treated so; and as she turned for a last glimpse of\r\nhim, whilst the crowd was swallowing her from his sight, she seemed so\r\nwounded, so broken-hearted, that a shame fell upon him which consumed\r\nhis pride to ashes, and withered his stolen royalty.  His grandeurs were\r\nstricken valueless: they seemed to fall away from him like rotten rags.\r\n\r\nThe procession moved on, and still on, through ever augmenting\r\nsplendours and ever augmenting tempests of welcome; but to Tom Canty\r\nthey were as if they had not been.  He neither saw nor heard.  Royalty\r\nhad lost its grace and sweetness; its pomps were become a reproach.\r\n Remorse was eating his heart out.  He said, “Would God I were free of\r\nmy captivity!”\r\n\r\nHe had unconsciously dropped back into the phraseology of the first days\r\nof his compulsory greatness.\r\n\r\nThe shining pageant still went winding like a radiant and interminable\r\nserpent down the crooked lanes of the quaint old city, and through the\r\nhuzzaing hosts; but still the King rode with bowed head and vacant eyes,\r\nseeing only his mother’s face and that wounded look in it.\r\n\r\n“Largess, largess!”  The cry fell upon an unheeding ear.\r\n\r\n“Long live Edward of England!”  It seemed as if the earth shook with the\r\nexplosion; but there was no response from the King.  He heard it only as\r\none hears the thunder of the surf when it is blown to the ear out of a\r\ngreat distance, for it was smothered under another sound which was still\r\nnearer, in his own breast, in his accusing conscience--a voice which\r\nkept repeating those shameful words, “I do not know you, woman!”\r\n\r\nThe words smote upon the King’s soul as the strokes of a funeral bell\r\nsmite upon the soul of a surviving friend when they remind him of secret\r\ntreacheries suffered at his hands by him that is gone.\r\n\r\nNew glories were unfolded at every turning; new wonders, new marvels,\r\nsprang into view; the pent clamours of waiting batteries were released;\r\nnew raptures poured from the throats of the waiting multitudes:  but the\r\nKing gave no sign, and the accusing voice that went moaning through his\r\ncomfortless breast was all the sound he heard.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by the gladness in the faces of the populace changed a little,\r\nand became touched with a something like solicitude or anxiety:  an\r\nabatement in the volume of the applause was observable too.  The Lord\r\nProtector was quick to notice these things:  he was as quick to detect\r\nthe cause.  He spurred to the King’s side, bent low in his saddle,\r\nuncovered, and said--\r\n\r\n“My liege, it is an ill time for dreaming.  The people observe thy\r\ndowncast head, thy clouded mien, and they take it for an omen.  Be\r\nadvised:  unveil the sun of royalty, and let it shine upon these boding\r\nvapours, and disperse them.  Lift up thy face, and smile upon the\r\npeople.”\r\n\r\nSo saying, the Duke scattered a handful of coins to right and left, then\r\nretired to his place.  The mock King did mechanically as he had been\r\nbidden.  His smile had no heart in it, but few eyes were near enough\r\nor sharp enough to detect that.  The noddings of his plumed head as he\r\nsaluted his subjects were full of grace and graciousness; the largess\r\nwhich he delivered from his hand was royally liberal:  so the people’s\r\nanxiety vanished, and the acclamations burst forth again in as mighty a\r\nvolume as before.\r\n\r\nStill once more, a little before the progress was ended, the Duke was\r\nobliged to ride forward, and make remonstrance.  He whispered--\r\n\r\n“O dread sovereign! shake off these fatal humours; the eyes of the world\r\nare upon thee.”  Then he added with sharp annoyance, “Perdition catch\r\nthat crazy pauper! ’twas she that hath disturbed your Highness.”\r\n\r\nThe gorgeous figure turned a lustreless eye upon the Duke, and said in a\r\ndead voice--\r\n\r\n“She was my mother!”\r\n\r\n“My God!” groaned the Protector as he reined his horse backward to his\r\npost, “the omen was pregnant with prophecy.  He is gone mad again!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII. Coronation Day.\r\n\r\nLet us go backward a few hours, and place ourselves in Westminster\r\nAbbey, at four o’clock in the morning of this memorable Coronation Day.\r\n We are not without company; for although it is still night, we find\r\nthe torch-lighted galleries already filling up with people who are well\r\ncontent to sit still and wait seven or eight hours till the time shall\r\ncome for them to see what they may not hope to see twice in their\r\nlives--the coronation of a King.  Yes, London and Westminster have been\r\nastir ever since the warning guns boomed at three o’clock, and already\r\ncrowds of untitled rich folk who have bought the privilege of trying\r\nto find sitting-room in the galleries are flocking in at the entrances\r\nreserved for their sort.\r\n\r\nThe hours drag along tediously enough.  All stir has ceased for some\r\ntime, for every gallery has long ago been packed.  We may sit, now, and\r\nlook and think at our leisure.  We have glimpses, here and there\r\nand yonder, through the dim cathedral twilight, of portions of many\r\ngalleries and balconies, wedged full with other people, the other\r\nportions of these galleries and balconies being cut off from sight by\r\nintervening pillars and architectural projections.  We have in view\r\nthe whole of the great north transept--empty, and waiting for England’s\r\nprivileged ones.  We see also the ample area or platform, carpeted with\r\nrich stuffs, whereon the throne stands.  The throne occupies the centre\r\nof the platform, and is raised above it upon an elevation of four steps.\r\nWithin the seat of the throne is enclosed a rough flat rock--the stone\r\nof Scone--which many generations of Scottish kings sat on to be crowned,\r\nand so it in time became holy enough to answer a like purpose for\r\nEnglish monarchs.  Both the throne and its footstool are covered with\r\ncloth of gold.\r\n\r\nStillness reigns, the torches blink dully, the time drags heavily.\r\nBut at last the lagging daylight asserts itself, the torches are\r\nextinguished, and a mellow radiance suffuses the great spaces. All\r\nfeatures of the noble building are distinct now, but soft and dreamy,\r\nfor the sun is lightly veiled with clouds.\r\n\r\nAt seven o’clock the first break in the drowsy monotony occurs; for on\r\nthe stroke of this hour the first peeress enters the transept, clothed\r\nlike Solomon for splendour, and is conducted to her appointed place\r\nby an official clad in satins and velvets, whilst a duplicate of him\r\ngathers up the lady’s long train, follows after, and, when the lady is\r\nseated, arranges the train across her lap for her.  He then places her\r\nfootstool according to her desire, after which he puts her coronet where\r\nit will be convenient to her hand when the time for the simultaneous\r\ncoroneting of the nobles shall arrive.\r\n\r\nBy this time the peeresses are flowing in in a glittering stream, and\r\nthe satin-clad officials are flitting and glinting everywhere, seating\r\nthem and making them comfortable.  The scene is animated enough now.\r\n There is stir and life, and shifting colour everywhere.  After a time,\r\nquiet reigns again; for the peeresses are all come and are all in their\r\nplaces, a solid acre or such a matter, of human flowers, resplendent in\r\nvariegated colours, and frosted like a Milky Way with diamonds.  There\r\nare all ages here: brown, wrinkled, white-haired dowagers who are able\r\nto go back, and still back, down the stream of time, and recall the\r\ncrowning of Richard III. and the troublous days of that old forgotten\r\nage; and there are handsome middle-aged dames; and lovely and gracious\r\nyoung matrons; and gentle and beautiful young girls, with beaming eyes\r\nand fresh complexions, who may possibly put on their jewelled coronets\r\nawkwardly when the great time comes; for the matter will be new to\r\nthem, and their excitement will be a sore hindrance. Still, this may\r\nnot happen, for the hair of all these ladies has been arranged with a\r\nspecial view to the swift and successful lodging of the crown in its\r\nplace when the signal comes.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that this massed array of peeresses is sown thick with\r\ndiamonds, and we also see that it is a marvellous spectacle--but now we\r\nare about to be astonished in earnest.  About nine, the clouds suddenly\r\nbreak away and a shaft of sunshine cleaves the mellow atmosphere, and\r\ndrifts slowly along the ranks of ladies; and every rank it touches\r\nflames into a dazzling splendour of many-coloured fires, and we tingle\r\nto our finger-tips with the electric thrill that is shot through us by\r\nthe surprise and the beauty of the spectacle!  Presently a special envoy\r\nfrom some distant corner of the Orient, marching with the general body\r\nof foreign ambassadors, crosses this bar of sunshine, and we catch our\r\nbreath, the glory that streams and flashes and palpitates about him is\r\nso overpowering; for he is crusted from head to heel with gems, and his\r\nslightest movement showers a dancing radiance all around him.\r\n\r\nLet us change the tense for convenience.  The time drifted along--one\r\nhour--two hours--two hours and a half; then the deep booming of\r\nartillery told that the King and his grand procession had arrived at\r\nlast; so the waiting multitude rejoiced.  All knew that a further delay\r\nmust follow, for the King must be prepared and robed for the solemn\r\nceremony; but this delay would be pleasantly occupied by the assembling\r\nof the peers of the realm in their stately robes.  These were conducted\r\nceremoniously to their seats, and their coronets placed conveniently\r\nat hand; and meanwhile the multitude in the galleries were alive with\r\ninterest, for most of them were beholding for the first time, dukes,\r\nearls, and barons, whose names had been historical for five hundred\r\nyears.  When all were finally seated, the spectacle from the galleries\r\nand all coigns of vantage was complete; a gorgeous one to look upon and\r\nto remember.\r\n\r\nNow the robed and mitred great heads of the church, and their\r\nattendants, filed in upon the platform and took their appointed places;\r\nthese were followed by the Lord Protector and other great officials, and\r\nthese again by a steel-clad detachment of the Guard.\r\n\r\nThere was a waiting pause; then, at a signal, a triumphant peal of music\r\nburst forth, and Tom Canty, clothed in a long robe of cloth of gold,\r\nappeared at a door, and stepped upon the platform.  The entire multitude\r\nrose, and the ceremony of the Recognition ensued.\r\n\r\nThen a noble anthem swept the Abbey with its rich waves of sound; and\r\nthus heralded and welcomed, Tom Canty was conducted to the throne.\r\n The ancient ceremonies went on, with impressive solemnity, whilst the\r\naudience gazed; and as they drew nearer and nearer to completion, Tom\r\nCanty grew pale, and still paler, and a deep and steadily deepening woe\r\nand despondency settled down upon his spirits and upon his remorseful\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nAt last the final act was at hand.  The Archbishop of Canterbury lifted\r\nup the crown of England from its cushion and held it out over the\r\ntrembling mock-King’s head.  In the same instant a rainbow-radiance\r\nflashed along the spacious transept; for with one impulse every\r\nindividual in the great concourse of nobles lifted a coronet and poised\r\nit over his or her head--and paused in that attitude.\r\n\r\nA deep hush pervaded the Abbey.  At this impressive moment, a startling\r\napparition intruded upon the scene--an apparition observed by none in\r\nthe absorbed multitude, until it suddenly appeared, moving up the great\r\ncentral aisle.  It was a boy, bareheaded, ill shod, and clothed in\r\ncoarse plebeian garments that were falling to rags.  He raised his hand\r\nwith a solemnity which ill comported with his soiled and sorry aspect,\r\nand delivered this note of warning--\r\n\r\n“I forbid you to set the crown of England upon that forfeited head.  I\r\nam the King!”\r\n\r\nIn an instant several indignant hands were laid upon the boy; but in\r\nthe same instant Tom Canty, in his regal vestments, made a swift step\r\nforward, and cried out in a ringing voice--\r\n\r\n“Loose him and forbear!  He _is_ the King!”\r\n\r\nA sort of panic of astonishment swept the assemblage, and they partly\r\nrose in their places and stared in a bewildered way at one another and\r\nat the chief figures in this scene, like persons who wondered whether\r\nthey were awake and in their senses, or asleep and dreaming.  The Lord\r\nProtector was as amazed as the rest, but quickly recovered himself, and\r\nexclaimed in a voice of authority--\r\n\r\n“Mind not his Majesty, his malady is upon him again--seize the\r\nvagabond!”\r\n\r\nHe would have been obeyed, but the mock-King stamped his foot and cried\r\nout--\r\n\r\n“On your peril!  Touch him not, he is the King!”\r\n\r\nThe hands were withheld; a paralysis fell upon the house; no one moved,\r\nno one spoke; indeed, no one knew how to act or what to say, in so\r\nstrange and surprising an emergency.  While all minds were struggling to\r\nright themselves, the boy still moved steadily forward, with high port\r\nand confident mien; he had never halted from the beginning; and while\r\nthe tangled minds still floundered helplessly, he stepped upon the\r\nplatform, and the mock-King ran with a glad face to meet him; and fell\r\non his knees before him and said--\r\n\r\n“Oh, my lord the King, let poor Tom Canty be first to swear fealty to\r\nthee, and say, ‘Put on thy crown and enter into thine own again!’”\r\n\r\nThe Lord Protector’s eye fell sternly upon the new-comer’s face; but\r\nstraightway the sternness vanished away, and gave place to an expression\r\nof wondering surprise.  This thing happened also to the other great\r\nofficers.  They glanced at each other, and retreated a step by a common\r\nand unconscious impulse.  The thought in each mind was the same:  “What\r\na strange resemblance!”\r\n\r\nThe Lord Protector reflected a moment or two in perplexity, then he\r\nsaid, with grave respectfulness--\r\n\r\n“By your favour, sir, I desire to ask certain questions which--”\r\n\r\n“I will answer them, my lord.”\r\n\r\nThe Duke asked him many questions about the Court, the late King, the\r\nprince, the princesses--the boy answered them correctly and without\r\nhesitating.  He described the rooms of state in the palace, the late\r\nKing’s apartments, and those of the Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\nIt was strange; it was wonderful; yes, it was unaccountable--so all said\r\nthat heard it.  The tide was beginning to turn, and Tom Canty’s hopes to\r\nrun high, when the Lord Protector shook his head and said--\r\n\r\n“It is true it is most wonderful--but it is no more than our lord the\r\nKing likewise can do.”  This remark, and this reference to himself as\r\nstill the King, saddened Tom Canty, and he felt his hopes crumbling from\r\nunder him.  “These are not _proofs_,” added the Protector.\r\n\r\nThe tide was turning very fast now, very fast indeed--but in the wrong\r\ndirection; it was leaving poor Tom Canty stranded on the throne,\r\nand sweeping the other out to sea.  The Lord Protector communed with\r\nhimself--shook his head--the thought forced itself upon him, “It is\r\nperilous to the State and to us all, to entertain so fateful a riddle as\r\nthis; it could divide the nation and undermine the throne.”  He turned\r\nand said--\r\n\r\n“Sir Thomas, arrest this--No, hold!”  His face lighted, and he\r\nconfronted the ragged candidate with this question--\r\n\r\n“Where lieth the Great Seal?  Answer me this truly, and the riddle is\r\nunriddled; for only he that was Prince of Wales _can_ so answer! On so\r\ntrivial a thing hang a throne and a dynasty!”\r\n\r\nIt was a lucky thought, a happy thought.  That it was so considered by\r\nthe great officials was manifested by the silent applause that shot from\r\neye to eye around their circle in the form of bright approving glances.\r\nYes, none but the true prince could dissolve the stubborn mystery of the\r\nvanished Great Seal--this forlorn little impostor had been taught his\r\nlesson well, but here his teachings must fail, for his teacher himself\r\ncould not answer _that_ question--ah, very good, very good indeed;\r\nnow we shall be rid of this troublesome and perilous business in\r\nshort order! And so they nodded invisibly and smiled inwardly with\r\nsatisfaction, and looked to see this foolish lad stricken with a palsy\r\nof guilty confusion. How surprised they were, then, to see nothing of\r\nthe sort happen--how they marvelled to hear him answer up promptly, in a\r\nconfident and untroubled voice, and say--\r\n\r\n“There is nought in this riddle that is difficult.”  Then, without so\r\nmuch as a by-your-leave to anybody, he turned and gave this command,\r\nwith the easy manner of one accustomed to doing such things: “My Lord\r\nSt. John, go you to my private cabinet in the palace--for none knoweth\r\nthe place better than you--and, close down to the floor, in the left\r\ncorner remotest from the door that opens from the ante-chamber, you\r\nshall find in the wall a brazen nail-head; press upon it and a little\r\njewel-closet will fly open which not even you do know of--no, nor\r\nany soul else in all the world but me and the trusty artisan that did\r\ncontrive it for me. The first thing that falleth under your eye will be\r\nthe Great Seal--fetch it hither.”\r\n\r\nAll the company wondered at this speech, and wondered still more to see\r\nthe little mendicant pick out this peer without hesitancy or apparent\r\nfear of mistake, and call him by name with such a placidly convincing\r\nair of having known him all his life.  The peer was almost surprised\r\ninto obeying.  He even made a movement as if to go, but quickly\r\nrecovered his tranquil attitude and confessed his blunder with a blush.\r\n Tom Canty turned upon him and said, sharply--\r\n\r\n“Why dost thou hesitate?  Hast not heard the King’s command?  Go!”\r\n\r\nThe Lord St. John made a deep obeisance--and it was observed that it was\r\na significantly cautious and non-committal one, it not being delivered\r\nat either of the kings, but at the neutral ground about half-way between\r\nthe two--and took his leave.\r\n\r\nNow began a movement of the gorgeous particles of that official group\r\nwhich was slow, scarcely perceptible, and yet steady and persistent--a\r\nmovement such as is observed in a kaleidoscope that is turned slowly,\r\nwhereby the components of one splendid cluster fall away and join\r\nthemselves to another--a movement which, little by little, in the\r\npresent case, dissolved the glittering crowd that stood about Tom Canty\r\nand clustered it together again in the neighbourhood of the new-comer.\r\n Tom Canty stood almost alone. Now ensued a brief season of deep\r\nsuspense and waiting--during which even the few faint hearts still\r\nremaining near Tom Canty gradually scraped together courage enough to\r\nglide, one by one, over to the majority.  So at last Tom Canty, in his\r\nroyal robes and jewels, stood wholly alone and isolated from the world,\r\na conspicuous figure, occupying an eloquent vacancy.\r\n\r\nNow the Lord St. John was seen returning.  As he advanced up\r\nthe mid-aisle the interest was so intense that the low murmur of\r\nconversation in the great assemblage died out and was succeeded by\r\na profound hush, a breathless stillness, through which his footfalls\r\npulsed with a dull and distant sound.  Every eye was fastened upon him\r\nas he moved along.  He reached the platform, paused a moment, then moved\r\ntoward Tom Canty with a deep obeisance, and said--\r\n\r\n“Sire, the Seal is not there!”\r\n\r\nA mob does not melt away from the presence of a plague-patient with more\r\nhaste than the band of pallid and terrified courtiers melted away from\r\nthe presence of the shabby little claimant of the Crown.  In a moment\r\nhe stood all alone, without friend or supporter, a target upon which\r\nwas concentrated a bitter fire of scornful and angry looks.  The Lord\r\nProtector called out fiercely--\r\n\r\n“Cast the beggar into the street, and scourge him through the town--the\r\npaltry knave is worth no more consideration!”\r\n\r\nOfficers of the guard sprang forward to obey, but Tom Canty waved them\r\noff and said--\r\n\r\n“Back!  Whoso touches him perils his life!”\r\n\r\nThe Lord Protector was perplexed in the last degree.  He said to the\r\nLord St. John--\r\n\r\n“Searched you well?--but it boots not to ask that.  It doth seem passing\r\nstrange.  Little things, trifles, slip out of one’s ken, and one does\r\nnot think it matter for surprise; but how so bulky a thing as the\r\nSeal of England can vanish away and no man be able to get track of it\r\nagain--a massy golden disk--”\r\n\r\nTom Canty, with beaming eyes, sprang forward and shouted--\r\n\r\n“Hold, that is enough!  Was it round?--and thick?--and had it letters\r\nand devices graved upon it?--yes?  Oh, _now_ I know what this Great Seal\r\nis that there’s been such worry and pother about. An’ ye had described\r\nit to me, ye could have had it three weeks ago.  Right well I know where\r\nit lies; but it was not I that put it there--first.”\r\n\r\n“Who, then, my liege?” asked the Lord Protector.\r\n\r\n“He that stands there--the rightful King of England.  And he shall tell\r\nyou himself where it lies--then you will believe he knew it of his own\r\nknowledge.  Bethink thee, my King--spur thy memory--it was the last, the\r\nvery _last_ thing thou didst that day before thou didst rush forth from\r\nthe palace, clothed in my rags, to punish the soldier that insulted me.”\r\n\r\nA silence ensued, undisturbed by a movement or a whisper, and all eyes\r\nwere fixed upon the new-comer, who stood, with bent head and corrugated\r\nbrow, groping in his memory among a thronging multitude of valueless\r\nrecollections for one single little elusive fact, which, found, would\r\nseat him upon a throne--unfound, would leave him as he was, for good and\r\nall--a pauper and an outcast.  Moment after moment passed--the moments\r\nbuilt themselves into minutes--still the boy struggled silently on, and\r\ngave no sign.  But at last he heaved a sigh, shook his head slowly, and\r\nsaid, with a trembling lip and in a despondent voice--\r\n\r\n“I call the scene back--all of it--but the Seal hath no place in it.”\r\n  He paused, then looked up, and said with gentle dignity, “My lords and\r\ngentlemen, if ye will rob your rightful sovereign of his own for lack of\r\nthis evidence which he is not able to furnish, I may not stay ye, being\r\npowerless.  But--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, folly, oh, madness, my King!” cried Tom Canty, in a panic,\r\n“wait!--think!  Do not give up!--the cause is not lost!  Nor _shall_ be,\r\nneither! List to what I say--follow every word--I am going to bring that\r\nmorning back again, every hap just as it happened.  We talked--I told\r\nyou of my sisters, Nan and Bet--ah, yes, you remember that; and about\r\nmine old grandam--and the rough games of the lads of Offal Court--yes,\r\nyou remember these things also; very well, follow me still, you shall\r\nrecall everything.  You gave me food and drink, and did with princely\r\ncourtesy send away the servants, so that my low breeding might not shame\r\nme before them--ah, yes, this also you remember.”\r\n\r\nAs Tom checked off his details, and the other boy nodded his head in\r\nrecognition of them, the great audience and the officials stared in\r\npuzzled wonderment; the tale sounded like true history, yet how could\r\nthis impossible conjunction between a prince and a beggar-boy have come\r\nabout?  Never was a company of people so perplexed, so interested, and\r\nso stupefied, before.\r\n\r\n“For a jest, my prince, we did exchange garments.  Then we stood before\r\na mirror; and so alike were we that both said it seemed as if there had\r\nbeen no change made--yes, you remember that.  Then you noticed that the\r\nsoldier had hurt my hand--look! here it is, I cannot yet even write with\r\nit, the fingers are so stiff.  At this your Highness sprang up, vowing\r\nvengeance upon that soldier, and ran towards the door--you passed a\r\ntable--that thing you call the Seal lay on that table--you snatched\r\nit up and looked eagerly about, as if for a place to hide it--your eye\r\ncaught sight of--”\r\n\r\n“There, ’tis sufficient!--and the good God be thanked!” exclaimed the\r\nragged claimant, in a mighty excitement.  “Go, my good St. John--in an\r\narm-piece of the Milanese armour that hangs on the wall, thou’lt find\r\nthe Seal!”\r\n\r\n“Right, my King! right!” cried Tom Canty; “_Now_ the sceptre of England\r\nis thine own; and it were better for him that would dispute it that he\r\nhad been born dumb!  Go, my Lord St. John, give thy feet wings!”\r\n\r\nThe whole assemblage was on its feet now, and well-nigh out of its mind\r\nwith uneasiness, apprehension, and consuming excitement.  On the floor\r\nand on the platform a deafening buzz of frantic conversation burst\r\nforth, and for some time nobody knew anything or heard anything or was\r\ninterested in anything but what his neighbour was shouting into his ear,\r\nor he was shouting into his neighbour’s ear.  Time--nobody knew how much\r\nof it--swept by unheeded and unnoted.  At last a sudden hush fell upon\r\nthe house, and in the same moment St. John appeared upon the platform,\r\nand held the Great Seal aloft in his hand.  Then such a shout went up--\r\n\r\n“Long live the true King!”\r\n\r\nFor five minutes the air quaked with shouts and the crash of musical\r\ninstruments, and was white with a storm of waving handkerchiefs; and\r\nthrough it all a ragged lad, the most conspicuous figure in England,\r\nstood, flushed and happy and proud, in the centre of the spacious\r\nplatform, with the great vassals of the kingdom kneeling around him.\r\n\r\nThen all rose, and Tom Canty cried out--\r\n\r\n“Now, O my King, take these regal garments back, and give poor Tom, thy\r\nservant, his shreds and remnants again.”\r\n\r\nThe Lord Protector spoke up--\r\n\r\n“Let the small varlet be stripped and flung into the Tower.”\r\n\r\nBut the new King, the true King, said--\r\n\r\n“I will not have it so.  But for him I had not got my crown again--none\r\nshall lay a hand upon him to harm him.  And as for thee, my good uncle,\r\nmy Lord Protector, this conduct of thine is not grateful toward\r\nthis poor lad, for I hear he hath made thee a duke”--the Protector\r\nblushed--“yet he was not a king; wherefore what is thy fine title\r\nworth now?  To-morrow you shall sue to me, _through him_, for its\r\nconfirmation, else no duke, but a simple earl, shalt thou remain.”\r\n\r\nUnder this rebuke, his Grace the Duke of Somerset retired a little from\r\nthe front for the moment.  The King turned to Tom, and said kindly--“My\r\npoor boy, how was it that you could remember where I hid the Seal when I\r\ncould not remember it myself?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, my King, that was easy, since I used it divers days.”\r\n\r\n“Used it--yet could not explain where it was?”\r\n\r\n“I did not know it was _that_ they wanted.  They did not describe it,\r\nyour Majesty.”\r\n\r\n“Then how used you it?”\r\n\r\nThe red blood began to steal up into Tom’s cheeks, and he dropped his\r\neyes and was silent.\r\n\r\n“Speak up, good lad, and fear nothing,” said the King.  “How used you\r\nthe Great Seal of England?”\r\n\r\nTom stammered a moment, in a pathetic confusion, then got it out--\r\n\r\n“To crack nuts with!”\r\n\r\nPoor child, the avalanche of laughter that greeted this nearly swept him\r\noff his feet.  But if a doubt remained in any mind that Tom Canty was\r\nnot the King of England and familiar with the august appurtenances of\r\nroyalty, this reply disposed of it utterly.\r\n\r\nMeantime the sumptuous robe of state had been removed from Tom’s\r\nshoulders to the King’s, whose rags were effectually hidden from sight\r\nunder it.  Then the coronation ceremonies were resumed; the true King\r\nwas anointed and the crown set upon his head, whilst cannon thundered\r\nthe news to the city, and all London seemed to rock with applause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII. Edward as King.\r\n\r\nMiles Hendon was picturesque enough before he got into the riot on\r\nLondon Bridge--he was more so when he got out of it.  He had but little\r\nmoney when he got in, none at all when he got out.  The pickpockets had\r\nstripped him of his last farthing.\r\n\r\nBut no matter, so he found his boy.  Being a soldier, he did not go at\r\nhis task in a random way, but set to work, first of all, to arrange his\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nWhat would the boy naturally do?  Where would he naturally go?\r\nWell--argued Miles--he would naturally go to his former haunts, for that\r\nis the instinct of unsound minds, when homeless and forsaken, as well\r\nas of sound ones.  Whereabouts were his former haunts?  His rags,\r\ntaken together with the low villain who seemed to know him and who even\r\nclaimed to be his father, indicated that his home was in one or another\r\nof the poorest and meanest districts of London.  Would the search for\r\nhim be difficult, or long?  No, it was likely to be easy and brief.  He\r\nwould not hunt for the boy, he would hunt for a crowd; in the centre of\r\na big crowd or a little one, sooner or later, he should find his poor\r\nlittle friend, sure; and the mangy mob would be entertaining itself\r\nwith pestering and aggravating the boy, who would be proclaiming himself\r\nKing, as usual.  Then Miles Hendon would cripple some of those people,\r\nand carry off his little ward, and comfort and cheer him with loving\r\nwords, and the two would never be separated any more.\r\n\r\nSo Miles started on his quest.  Hour after hour he tramped through back\r\nalleys and squalid streets, seeking groups and crowds, and finding no\r\nend of them, but never any sign of the boy.  This greatly surprised him,\r\nbut did not discourage him.  To his notion, there was nothing the matter\r\nwith his plan of campaign; the only miscalculation about it was that the\r\ncampaign was becoming a lengthy one, whereas he had expected it to be\r\nshort.\r\n\r\nWhen daylight arrived, at last, he had made many a mile, and canvassed\r\nmany a crowd, but the only result was that he was tolerably tired,\r\nrather hungry and very sleepy.  He wanted some breakfast, but there was\r\nno way to get it.  To beg for it did not occur to him; as to pawning\r\nhis sword, he would as soon have thought of parting with his honour;\r\nhe could spare some of his clothes--yes, but one could as easily find a\r\ncustomer for a disease as for such clothes.\r\n\r\nAt noon he was still tramping--among the rabble which followed after\r\nthe royal procession, now; for he argued that this regal display would\r\nattract his little lunatic powerfully.  He followed the pageant through\r\nall its devious windings about London, and all the way to Westminster\r\nand the Abbey.  He drifted here and there amongst the multitudes\r\nthat were massed in the vicinity for a weary long time, baffled and\r\nperplexed, and finally wandered off, thinking, and trying to contrive\r\nsome way to better his plan of campaign.  By-and-by, when he came to\r\nhimself out of his musings, he discovered that the town was far behind\r\nhim and that the day was growing old.  He was near the river, and in the\r\ncountry; it was a region of fine rural seats--not the sort of district\r\nto welcome clothes like his.\r\n\r\nIt was not at all cold; so he stretched himself on the ground in the lee\r\nof a hedge to rest and think.  Drowsiness presently began to settle upon\r\nhis senses; the faint and far-off boom of cannon was wafted to his ear,\r\nand he said to himself, “The new King is crowned,” and straightway fell\r\nasleep.  He had not slept or rested, before, for more than thirty hours.\r\nHe did not wake again until near the middle of the next morning.\r\n\r\nHe got up, lame, stiff, and half famished, washed himself in the river,\r\nstayed his stomach with a pint or two of water, and trudged off toward\r\nWestminster, grumbling at himself for having wasted so much time.\r\n Hunger helped him to a new plan, now; he would try to get speech with\r\nold Sir Humphrey Marlow and borrow a few marks, and--but that was enough\r\nof a plan for the present; it would be time enough to enlarge it when\r\nthis first stage should be accomplished.\r\n\r\nToward eleven o’clock he approached the palace; and although a host of\r\nshowy people were about him, moving in the same direction, he was not\r\ninconspicuous--his costume took care of that.  He watched these people’s\r\nfaces narrowly, hoping to find a charitable one whose possessor might\r\nbe willing to carry his name to the old lieutenant--as to trying to get\r\ninto the palace himself, that was simply out of the question.\r\n\r\nPresently our whipping-boy passed him, then wheeled about and scanned\r\nhis figure well, saying to himself, “An’ that is not the very vagabond\r\nhis Majesty is in such a worry about, then am I an ass--though belike I\r\nwas that before.  He answereth the description to a rag--that God should\r\nmake two such would be to cheapen miracles by wasteful repetition.  I\r\nwould I could contrive an excuse to speak with him.”\r\n\r\nMiles Hendon saved him the trouble; for he turned about, then, as a man\r\ngenerally will when somebody mesmerises him by gazing hard at him from\r\nbehind; and observing a strong interest in the boy’s eyes, he stepped\r\ntoward him and said--\r\n\r\n“You have just come out from the palace; do you belong there?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, your worship.”\r\n\r\n“Know you Sir Humphrey Marlow?”\r\n\r\nThe boy started, and said to himself, “Lord! mine old departed father!”\r\n Then he answered aloud, “Right well, your worship.”\r\n\r\n“Good--is he within?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the boy; and added, to himself, “within his grave.”\r\n\r\n“Might I crave your favour to carry my name to him, and say I beg to say\r\na word in his ear?”\r\n\r\n“I will despatch the business right willingly, fair sir.”\r\n\r\n“Then say Miles Hendon, son of Sir Richard, is here without--I shall be\r\ngreatly bounden to you, my good lad.”\r\n\r\nThe boy looked disappointed.  “The King did not name him so,” he said to\r\nhimself; “but it mattereth not, this is his twin brother, and can give\r\nhis Majesty news of t’other Sir-Odds-and-Ends, I warrant.”  So he said\r\nto Miles, “Step in there a moment, good sir, and wait till I bring you\r\nword.”\r\n\r\nHendon retired to the place indicated--it was a recess sunk in the\r\npalace wall, with a stone bench in it--a shelter for sentinels in bad\r\nweather. He had hardly seated himself when some halberdiers, in charge\r\nof an officer, passed by.  The officer saw him, halted his men, and\r\ncommanded Hendon to come forth.  He obeyed, and was promptly arrested\r\nas a suspicious character prowling within the precincts of the palace.\r\n Things began to look ugly.  Poor Miles was going to explain, but the\r\nofficer roughly silenced him, and ordered his men to disarm him and\r\nsearch him.\r\n\r\n“God of his mercy grant that they find somewhat,” said poor Miles; “I\r\nhave searched enow, and failed, yet is my need greater than theirs.”\r\n\r\nNothing was found but a document.  The officer tore it open, and Hendon\r\nsmiled when he recognised the ‘pot-hooks’ made by his lost little friend\r\nthat black day at Hendon Hall.  The officer’s face grew dark as he read\r\nthe English paragraph, and Miles blenched to the opposite colour as he\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\n“Another new claimant of the Crown!” cried the officer.  “Verily they\r\nbreed like rabbits, to-day.  Seize the rascal, men, and see ye keep\r\nhim fast whilst I convey this precious paper within and send it to the\r\nKing.”\r\n\r\nHe hurried away, leaving the prisoner in the grip of the halberdiers.\r\n\r\n“Now is my evil luck ended at last,” muttered Hendon, “for I shall\r\ndangle at a rope’s end for a certainty, by reason of that bit of\r\nwriting.  And what will become of my poor lad!--ah, only the good God\r\nknoweth.”\r\n\r\nBy-and-by he saw the officer coming again, in a great hurry; so he\r\nplucked his courage together, purposing to meet his trouble as became a\r\nman.  The officer ordered the men to loose the prisoner and return his\r\nsword to him; then bowed respectfully, and said--\r\n\r\n“Please you, sir, to follow me.”\r\n\r\nHendon followed, saying to himself, “An’ I were not travelling to death\r\nand judgment, and so must needs economise in sin, I would throttle this\r\nknave for his mock courtesy.”\r\n\r\nThe two traversed a populous court, and arrived at the grand entrance of\r\nthe palace, where the officer, with another bow, delivered Hendon into\r\nthe hands of a gorgeous official, who received him with profound respect\r\nand led him forward through a great hall, lined on both sides with rows\r\nof splendid flunkeys (who made reverential obeisance as the two passed\r\nalong, but fell into death-throes of silent laughter at our stately\r\nscarecrow the moment his back was turned), and up a broad staircase,\r\namong flocks of fine folk, and finally conducted him into a vast room,\r\nclove a passage for him through the assembled nobility of England, then\r\nmade a bow, reminded him to take his hat off, and left him standing in\r\nthe middle of the room, a mark for all eyes, for plenty of indignant\r\nfrowns, and for a sufficiency of amused and derisive smiles.\r\n\r\nMiles Hendon was entirely bewildered.  There sat the young King, under\r\na canopy of state, five steps away, with his head bent down and aside,\r\nspeaking with a sort of human bird of paradise--a duke, maybe.  Hendon\r\nobserved to himself that it was hard enough to be sentenced to death\r\nin the full vigour of life, without having this peculiarly public\r\nhumiliation added.  He wished the King would hurry about it--some of the\r\ngaudy people near by were becoming pretty offensive.  At this moment\r\nthe King raised his head slightly, and Hendon caught a good view of his\r\nface. The sight nearly took his breath away!--He stood gazing at the\r\nfair young face like one transfixed; then presently ejaculated--\r\n\r\n“Lo, the Lord of the Kingdom of Dreams and Shadows on his throne!”\r\n\r\nHe muttered some broken sentences, still gazing and marvelling; then\r\nturned his eyes around and about, scanning the gorgeous throng and the\r\nsplendid saloon, murmuring, “But these are _real_--verily these are\r\n_real_--surely it is not a dream.”\r\n\r\nHe stared at the King again--and thought, “_Is_ it a dream . . . or _is_\r\nhe the veritable Sovereign of England, and not the friendless poor Tom\r\no’ Bedlam I took him for--who shall solve me this riddle?”\r\n\r\nA sudden idea flashed in his eye, and he strode to the wall, gathered up\r\na chair, brought it back, planted it on the floor, and sat down in it!\r\n\r\nA buzz of indignation broke out, a rough hand was laid upon him and a\r\nvoice exclaimed--\r\n\r\n“Up, thou mannerless clown! would’st sit in the presence of the King?”\r\n\r\nThe disturbance attracted his Majesty’s attention, who stretched forth\r\nhis hand and cried out--\r\n\r\n“Touch him not, it is his right!”\r\n\r\nThe throng fell back, stupefied.  The King went on--\r\n\r\n“Learn ye all, ladies, lords, and gentlemen, that this is my trusty and\r\nwell-beloved servant, Miles Hendon, who interposed his good sword and\r\nsaved his prince from bodily harm and possible death--and for this he is\r\na knight, by the King’s voice.  Also learn, that for a higher service,\r\nin that he saved his sovereign stripes and shame, taking these upon\r\nhimself, he is a peer of England, Earl of Kent, and shall have gold\r\nand lands meet for the dignity.  More--the privilege which he hath just\r\nexercised is his by royal grant; for we have ordained that the chiefs\r\nof his line shall have and hold the right to sit in the presence of the\r\nMajesty of England henceforth, age after age, so long as the crown shall\r\nendure.  Molest him not.”\r\n\r\nTwo persons, who, through delay, had only arrived from the country\r\nduring this morning, and had now been in this room only five minutes,\r\nstood listening to these words and looking at the King, then at the\r\nscarecrow, then at the King again, in a sort of torpid bewilderment.\r\n These were Sir Hugh and the Lady Edith.  But the new Earl did not\r\nsee them.  He was still staring at the monarch, in a dazed way, and\r\nmuttering--\r\n\r\n“Oh, body o’ me!  _this_ my pauper!  This my lunatic!  This is he whom\r\n_I_ would show what grandeur was, in my house of seventy rooms and\r\nseven-and-twenty servants!  This is he who had never known aught but\r\nrags for raiment, kicks for comfort, and offal for diet!  This is he\r\nwhom _I_ adopted and would make respectable! Would God I had a bag to\r\nhide my head in!”\r\n\r\nThen his manners suddenly came back to him, and he dropped upon his\r\nknees, with his hands between the King’s, and swore allegiance and did\r\nhomage for his lands and titles.  Then he rose and stood respectfully\r\naside, a mark still for all eyes--and much envy, too.\r\n\r\nNow the King discovered Sir Hugh, and spoke out with wrathful voice and\r\nkindling eye--\r\n\r\n“Strip this robber of his false show and stolen estates, and put him\r\nunder lock and key till I have need of him.”\r\n\r\nThe late Sir Hugh was led away.\r\n\r\nThere was a stir at the other end of the room, now; the assemblage fell\r\napart, and Tom Canty, quaintly but richly clothed, marched down, between\r\nthese living walls, preceded by an usher.  He knelt before the King, who\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n“I have learned the story of these past few weeks, and am well pleased\r\nwith thee.  Thou hast governed the realm with right royal gentleness and\r\nmercy.  Thou hast found thy mother and thy sisters again?  Good; they\r\nshall be cared for--and thy father shall hang, if thou desire it and the\r\nlaw consent.  Know, all ye that hear my voice, that from this day, they\r\nthat abide in the shelter of Christ’s Hospital and share the King’s\r\nbounty shall have their minds and hearts fed, as well as their baser\r\nparts; and this boy shall dwell there, and hold the chief place in its\r\nhonourable body of governors, during life.  And for that he hath been\r\na king, it is meet that other than common observance shall be his due;\r\nwherefore note this his dress of state, for by it he shall be known, and\r\nnone shall copy it; and wheresoever he shall come, it shall remind the\r\npeople that he hath been royal, in his time, and none shall deny him his\r\ndue of reverence or fail to give him salutation.  He hath the throne’s\r\nprotection, he hath the crown’s support, he shall be known and called by\r\nthe honourable title of the King’s Ward.”\r\n\r\nThe proud and happy Tom Canty rose and kissed the King’s hand, and was\r\nconducted from the presence.  He did not waste any time, but flew to his\r\nmother, to tell her and Nan and Bet all about it and get them to help\r\nhim enjoy the great news. {1}\r\n\r\nConclusion. Justice and retribution.\r\n\r\nWhen the mysteries were all cleared up, it came out, by confession of\r\nHugh Hendon, that his wife had repudiated Miles by his command, that\r\nday at Hendon Hall--a command assisted and supported by the perfectly\r\ntrustworthy promise that if she did not deny that he was Miles Hendon,\r\nand stand firmly to it, he would have her life; whereupon she said,\r\n“Take it!”--she did not value it--and she would not repudiate\r\nMiles; then the husband said he would spare her life but have Miles\r\nassassinated!  This was a different matter; so she gave her word and\r\nkept it.\r\n\r\nHugh was not prosecuted for his threats or for stealing his brother’s\r\nestates and title, because the wife and brother would not testify\r\nagainst him--and the former would not have been allowed to do it, even\r\nif she had wanted to.  Hugh deserted his wife and went over to the\r\ncontinent, where he presently died; and by-and-by the Earl of Kent\r\nmarried his relict. There were grand times and rejoicings at Hendon\r\nvillage when the couple paid their first visit to the Hall.\r\n\r\nTom Canty’s father was never heard of again.\r\n\r\nThe King sought out the farmer who had been branded and sold as a slave,\r\nand reclaimed him from his evil life with the Ruffler’s gang, and put\r\nhim in the way of a comfortable livelihood.\r\n\r\nHe also took that old lawyer out of prison and remitted his fine. He\r\nprovided good homes for the daughters of the two Baptist women whom he\r\nsaw burned at the stake, and roundly punished the official who laid the\r\nundeserved stripes upon Miles Hendon’s back.\r\n\r\nHe saved from the gallows the boy who had captured the stray falcon, and\r\nalso the woman who had stolen a remnant of cloth from a weaver; but he\r\nwas too late to save the man who had been convicted of killing a deer in\r\nthe royal forest.\r\n\r\nHe showed favour to the justice who had pitied him when he was supposed\r\nto have stolen a pig, and he had the gratification of seeing him grow in\r\nthe public esteem and become a great and honoured man.\r\n\r\nAs long as the King lived he was fond of telling the story of his\r\nadventures, all through, from the hour that the sentinel cuffed him\r\naway from the palace gate till the final midnight when he deftly mixed\r\nhimself into a gang of hurrying workmen and so slipped into the Abbey\r\nand climbed up and hid himself in the Confessor’s tomb, and then slept\r\nso long, next day, that he came within one of missing the Coronation\r\naltogether.  He said that the frequent rehearsing of the precious lesson\r\nkept him strong in his purpose to make its teachings yield benefits to\r\nhis people; and so, whilst his life was spared he should continue to\r\ntell the story, and thus keep its sorrowful spectacles fresh in his\r\nmemory and the springs of pity replenished in his heart.\r\n\r\nMiles Hendon and Tom Canty were favourites of the King, all through his\r\nbrief reign, and his sincere mourners when he died. The good Earl\r\nof Kent had too much sense to abuse his peculiar privilege; but he\r\nexercised it twice after the instance we have seen of it before he was\r\ncalled from this world--once at the accession of Queen Mary, and once at\r\nthe accession of Queen Elizabeth.  A descendant of his exercised it\r\nat the accession of James I.  Before this one’s son chose to use the\r\nprivilege, near a quarter of a century had elapsed, and the ‘privilege\r\nof the Kents’ had faded out of most people’s memories; so, when the Kent\r\nof that day appeared before Charles I. and his court and sat down in the\r\nsovereign’s presence to assert and perpetuate the right of his house,\r\nthere was a fine stir indeed!  But the matter was soon explained, and\r\nthe right confirmed.  The last Earl of the line fell in the wars of the\r\nCommonwealth fighting for the King, and the odd privilege ended with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nTom Canty lived to be a very old man, a handsome, white-haired old\r\nfellow, of grave and benignant aspect.  As long as he lasted he was\r\nhonoured; and he was also reverenced, for his striking and peculiar\r\ncostume kept the people reminded that ‘in his time he had been royal;’\r\nso, wherever he appeared the crowd fell apart, making way for him, and\r\nwhispering, one to another, “Doff thy hat, it is the King’s Ward!”--and\r\nso they saluted, and got his kindly smile in return--and they valued it,\r\ntoo, for his was an honourable history.\r\n\r\nYes, King Edward VI. lived only a few years, poor boy, but he lived them\r\nworthily.  More than once, when some great dignitary, some gilded vassal\r\nof the crown, made argument against his leniency, and urged that some\r\nlaw which he was bent upon amending was gentle enough for its purpose,\r\nand wrought no suffering or oppression which any one need mightily mind,\r\nthe young King turned the mournful eloquence of his great compassionate\r\neyes upon him and answered--\r\n\r\n“What dost _thou_ know of suffering and oppression?  I and my people\r\nknow, but not thou.”\r\n\r\nThe reign of Edward VI. was a singularly merciful one for those harsh\r\ntimes.  Now that we are taking leave of him, let us try to keep this in\r\nour minds, to his credit.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES AND TWAIN’S NOTES\r\n\r\n{1}  For Mark Twain’s note see below under the relevant chapter heading.\r\n\r\n{2}  He refers to the order of baronets, or baronettes; the barones\r\nminores, as distinct from the parliamentary barons--not, it need hardly\r\nbe said, to the baronets of later creation.\r\n\r\n{3}  The lords of Kingsale, descendants of De Courcy, still enjoy this\r\ncurious privilege.\r\n\r\n{4}  Hume.\r\n\r\n{5}  Ib.\r\n\r\n{6}  Leigh Hunt’s ‘The Town,’ p.408, quotation from an early tourist.\r\n\r\n{7}  Canting terms for various kinds of thieves, beggars and vagabonds,\r\nand their female companions.\r\n\r\n{8}  From ‘The English Rogue.’  London, 1665.\r\n\r\n{9}  Hume’s England.\r\n\r\n{10}  See Dr. J.

Christ’s Hospital Costume.\r\n\r\nIt is most reasonable to regard the dress as copied from the costume\r\nof the citizens of London of that period, when long blue coats were the\r\ncommon habit of apprentices and serving-men, and yellow stockings\r\nwere generally worn; the coat fits closely to the body, but has loose\r\nsleeves, and beneath is worn a sleeveless yellow under-coat; around the\r\nwaist is a red leathern girdle; a clerical band around the neck, and\r\na small flat black cap, about the size of a saucer, completes the\r\ncostume.--Timbs’ Curiosities of London.\r\n\r\nNOTE 2, Chapter IV.\r\n\r\nIt appears that Christ’s Hospital was not originally founded as a\r\n_school_; its object was to rescue children from the streets, to\r\nshelter, feed, clothe them.--Timbs’ Curiosities of London.\r\n\r\nNOTE 3, Chapter V. The Duke of Norfolk’s Condemnation commanded.\r\n\r\nThe King was now approaching fast towards his end; and fearing lest\r\nNorfolk should escape him, he sent a message to the Commons, by which\r\nhe desired them to hasten the Bill, on pretence that Norfolk enjoyed the\r\ndignity of Earl Marshal, and it was necessary to appoint another, who\r\nmight officiate at the ensuing ceremony of installing his son Prince of\r\nWales.--Hume’s History of England, vol. iii. p. 307.\r\n\r\nNOTE 4, Chapter VII.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the end of this reign (Henry VIII.) that any salads,\r\ncarrots, turnips, or other edible roots were produced in England.  The\r\nlittle of these vegetables that was used was formerly imported from\r\nHolland and Flanders.  Queen Catherine, when she wanted a salad, was\r\nobliged to despatch a messenger thither on purpose.--Hume’s History of\r\nEngland, vol. iii. p. 314.\r\n\r\nNOTE 5, Chapter VIII. Attainder of Norfolk.\r\n\r\nThe House of Peers, without examining the prisoner, without trial or\r\nevidence, passed a Bill of Attainder against him and sent it down to the\r\nCommons . . . The obsequious Commons obeyed his (the King’s)\r\ndirections; and the King, having affixed the Royal assent to the Bill by\r\ncommissioners, issued orders for the execution of Norfolk on the morning\r\nof January 29 (the next day).--Hume’s History of England, vol iii. p\r\n306.\r\n\r\nNOTE 6, Chapter X. The Loving-cup.\r\n\r\nThe loving-cup, and the peculiar ceremonies observed in drinking from\r\nit, are older than English history.  It is thought that both are Danish\r\nimportations.  As far back as knowledge goes, the loving-cup has always\r\nbeen drunk at English banquets.  Tradition explains the ceremonies in\r\nthis way.  In the rude ancient times it was deemed a wise precaution\r\nto have both hands of both drinkers employed, lest while the pledger\r\npledged his love and fidelity to the pledgee, the pledgee take that\r\nopportunity to slip a dirk into him!\r\n\r\nNOTE 7, Chapter XI. The Duke of Norfolk’s narrow Escape.\r\n\r\nHad Henry VIII. survived a few hours longer, his order for the duke’s\r\nexecution would have been carried into effect. ‘But news being\r\ncarried to the Tower that the King himself had expired that night,\r\nthe lieutenant deferred obeying the warrant; and it was not thought\r\nadvisable by the Council to begin a new reign by the death of the\r\ngreatest nobleman in the kingdom, who had been condemned by a sentence\r\nso unjust and tyrannical.’--Hume’s History of England, vol. iii, p. 307.\r\n\r\nNOTE 8, Chapter XIV. The Whipping-boy.\r\n\r\nJames I. and Charles II. had whipping-boys, when they were little\r\nfellows, to take their punishment for them when they fell short in their\r\nlessons; so I have ventured to furnish my small prince with one, for my\r\nown purposes.\r\n\r\nNOTES to Chapter XV.\r\n\r\nCharacter of Hertford.\r\n\r\nThe young King discovered an extreme attachment to his uncle, who\r\nwas, in the main, a man of moderation and probity.--Hume’s History of\r\nEngland, vol. iii, p324.\r\n\r\nBut if he (the Protector) gave offence by assuming too much state, he\r\ndeserves great praise on account of the laws passed this session,\r\nby which the rigour of former statutes was much mitigated, and some\r\nsecurity given to the freedom of the constitution.  All laws were\r\nrepealed which extended the crime of treason beyond the statute of the\r\ntwenty-fifth of Edward III.; all laws enacted during the late reign\r\nextending the crime of felony; all the former laws against Lollardy or\r\nheresy, together with the statute of the Six Articles.  None were to be\r\naccused for words, but within a month after they were spoken.  By\r\nthese repeals several of the most rigorous laws that ever had passed\r\nin England were annulled; and some dawn, both of civil and religious\r\nliberty, began to appear to the people.  A repeal also passed of that\r\nlaw, the destruction of all laws, by which the King’s proclamation was\r\nmade of equal force with a statute.--Ibid. vol. iii. p. 339.\r\n\r\nBoiling to Death.\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Henry VIII. poisoners were, by Act of Parliament,\r\ncondemned to be _boiled to death_.  This Act was repealed in the\r\nfollowing reign.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, even in the seventeenth century, this horrible punishment\r\nwas inflicted on coiners and counterfeiters.  Taylor, the Water Poet,\r\ndescribes an execution he witnessed in Hamburg in 1616.  The judgment\r\npronounced against a coiner of false money was that he should ‘_be\r\nboiled to death in oil_; not thrown into the vessel at once, but with\r\na pulley or rope to be hanged under the armpits, and then let down into\r\nthe oil _by degrees_; first the feet, and next the legs, and so to boil\r\nhis flesh from his bones alive.’--Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull’s Blue Laws,\r\nTrue and False, p. 13.\r\n\r\nThe Famous Stocking Case.\r\n\r\nA woman and her daughter, _nine years old_, were hanged in Huntingdon\r\nfor selling their souls to the devil, and raising a storm by pulling off\r\ntheir stockings!--Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull’s Blue Laws, True and False,\r\np. 20.\r\n\r\nNOTE 10, Chapter XVII. Enslaving.\r\n\r\nSo young a King and so ignorant a peasant were likely to make mistakes;\r\nand this is an instance in point.  This peasant was suffering from this\r\nlaw _by anticipation_; the King was venting his indignation against a\r\nlaw which was not yet in existence; for this hideous statute was to\r\nhave birth in this little King’s _own reign_. However, we know, from the\r\nhumanity of his character, that it could never have been suggested by\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNOTES to Chapter XXIII. Death for Trifling Larcenies.\r\n\r\nWhen Connecticut and New Haven were framing their first codes, larceny\r\nabove the value of twelve pence was a capital crime in England--as it\r\nhad been since the time of Henry I.--Dr. J. Hammond Trumbull’s Blue\r\nLaws, True and False, p. 17.\r\n\r\nThe curious old book called The English Rogue makes the limit thirteen\r\npence ha’penny:  death being the portion of any who steal a thing ‘above\r\nthe value of thirteen pence ha’penny.’\r\n\r\nNOTES to Chapter XXVII.\r\n\r\nFrom many descriptions of larceny the law expressly took away the\r\nbenefit of clergy:  to steal a horse, or a _hawk_, or woollen cloth from\r\nthe weaver, was a hanging matter.  So it was to kill a deer from the\r\nKing’s forest, or to export sheep from the kingdom.--Dr. J. Hammond\r\nTrumbull’s Blue Laws, True and False, p.13.\r\n\r\nWilliam Prynne, a learned barrister, was sentenced (long after Edward\r\nVI.’s time) to lose both his ears in the pillory, to degradation from\r\nthe bar, a fine of 3,000 pounds, and imprisonment for life.  Three years\r\nafterwards he gave new offence to Laud by publishing a pamphlet against\r\nthe hierarchy.  He was again prosecuted, and was sentenced to lose _what\r\nremained of his ears_, to pay a fine of 5,000 pounds, to be _branded on\r\nboth his cheeks_ with the letters S. L. (for Seditious Libeller), and to\r\nremain in prison for life.  The severity of this sentence was equalled\r\nby the savage rigour of its execution.--Ibid. p. 12.\r\n\r\nNOTES to Chapter XXXIII.\r\n\r\nChrist’s Hospital, or Bluecoat School, ’the noblest institution in the\r\nworld.’\r\n\r\nThe ground on which the Priory of the Grey Friars stood was conferred\r\nby Henry VIII. on the Corporation of London (who caused the institution\r\nthere of a home for poor boys and girls). Subsequently, Edward VI.\r\ncaused the old Priory to be properly repaired, and founded within\r\nit that noble establishment called the Bluecoat School, or Christ’s\r\nHospital, for the _education_ and maintenance of orphans and the\r\nchildren of indigent persons . . . Edward would not let him (Bishop\r\nRidley) depart till the letter was written (to the Lord Mayor), and then\r\ncharged him to deliver it himself, and signify his special request and\r\ncommandment that no time might be lost in proposing what was convenient,\r\nand apprising him of the proceedings.  The work was zealously\r\nundertaken, Ridley himself engaging in it; and the result was the\r\nfounding of Christ’s Hospital for the education of poor children. (The\r\nKing endowed several other charities at the same time.) “Lord God,” said\r\nhe, “I yield Thee most hearty thanks that Thou hast given me life thus\r\nlong to finish this work to the glory of Thy name!”  That innocent and\r\nmost exemplary life was drawing rapidly to its close, and in a few days\r\nhe rendered up his spirit to his Creator, praying God to defend the\r\nrealm from Papistry.--J. Heneage Jesse’s London:  its Celebrated\r\nCharacters and Places.\r\n\r\nIn the Great Hall hangs a large picture of King Edward VI. seated on his\r\nthrone, in a scarlet and ermined robe, holding the sceptre in his left\r\nhand, and presenting with the other the Charter to the kneeling Lord\r\nMayor.  By his side stands the Chancellor, holding the seals, and next\r\nto him are other officers of state.  Bishop Ridley kneels before him\r\nwith uplifted hands, as if supplicating a blessing on the event; whilst\r\nthe Aldermen, etc., with the Lord Mayor, kneel on both sides, occupying\r\nthe middle ground of the picture; and lastly, in front, are a double row\r\nof boys on one side and girls on the other, from the master and matron\r\ndown to the boy and girl who have stepped forward from their respective\r\nrows, and kneel with raised hands before the King.--Timbs’ Curiosities\r\nof London, p. 98.\r\n\r\nChrist’s Hospital, by ancient custom, possesses the privilege of\r\naddressing the Sovereign on the occasion of his or her coming into the\r\nCity to partake of the hospitality of the Corporation of London.--Ibid.\r\n\r\nThe Dining Hall, with its lobby and organ-gallery, occupies the entire\r\nstorey, which is 187 feet long, 51 feet wide, and 47 feet high; it is\r\nlit by nine large windows, filled with stained glass on the south side;\r\nand is, next to Westminster Hall, the noblest room in the metropolis.\r\n Here the boys, now about 800 in number, dine; and here are held the\r\n‘Suppings in Public,’ to which visitors are admitted by tickets issued\r\nby the Treasurer and by the Governors of Christ’s Hospital.  The tables\r\nare laid with cheese in wooden bowls, beer in wooden piggins, poured\r\nfrom leathern jacks, and bread brought in large baskets.  The official\r\ncompany enter; the Lord Mayor, or President, takes his seat in a state\r\nchair made of oak from St. Catherine’s Church, by the Tower; a hymn\r\nis sung, accompanied by the organ; a ‘Grecian,’ or head boy, reads the\r\nprayers from the pulpit, silence being enforced by three drops of a\r\nwooden hammer.  After prayer the supper commences, and the visitors walk\r\nbetween the tables.  At its close the ’trade-boys’ take up the baskets,\r\nbowls, jacks, piggins, and candlesticks, and pass in procession, the\r\nbowing to the Governors being curiously formal.  This spectacle was\r\nwitnessed by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1845.\r\n\r\nAmong the more eminent Bluecoat boys are Joshua Barnes, editor\r\nof Anacreon and Euripides; Jeremiah Markland, the eminent critic,\r\nparticularly in Greek Literature; Camden, the antiquary; Bishop\r\nStillingfleet; Samuel Richardson, the novelist; Thomas Mitchell, the\r\ntranslator of Aristophanes; Thomas Barnes, many years editor of the\r\nLondon Times; Coleridge, Charles Lamb, and Leigh Hunt.\r\n\r\nNo boy is admitted before he is seven years old, or after he is nine;\r\nand no boy can remain in the school after he is fifteen, King’s boys and\r\n‘Grecians’ alone excepted.  There are about 500 Governors, at the head\r\nof whom are the Sovereign and the Prince of Wales.  The qualification\r\nfor a Governor is payment of 500 pounds.--Ibid.\r\n\r\nGENERAL NOTE.\r\n\r\nOne hears much about the ‘hideous Blue Laws of Connecticut,’ and is\r\naccustomed to shudder piously when they are mentioned.  There are people\r\nin America--and even in England!--who imagine that they were a very\r\nmonument of malignity, pitilessness, and inhumanity; whereas in reality\r\nthey were about the first _sweeping departure from judicial atrocity_\r\nwhich the ‘civilised’ world had seen.  This humane and kindly Blue Law\r\nCode, of two hundred and forty years ago, stands all by itself,\r\nwith ages of bloody law on the further side of it, and a century and\r\nthree-quarters of bloody English law on _this_ side of it.\r\n\r\nThere has never been a time--under the Blue Laws or any other--when\r\nabove _fourteen_ crimes were punishable by death in Connecticut.  But in\r\nEngland, within the memory of men who are still hale in body and mind,\r\n_two hundred and twenty-three_ crimes were punishable by death! {10}\r\n These facts are worth knowing--and worth thinking about, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Prince and The Pauper,\r\nComplete by Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens)\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PRINCE AND THE PAUPER ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 1837-0.txt or 1837-0.zip ***** This and\r\nall associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttps://www.gutenberg.org/1/8/3/1837/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Widger.

IN THE GARDEN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nTHERE IS NO ONE LEFT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mary Lennox was sent to Misselthwaite Manor to live with her uncle\r\neverybody said she was the most disagreeable-looking child ever seen.\r\nIt was true, too. She had a little thin face and a little thin body,\r\nthin light hair and a sour expression. Her hair was yellow, and her\r\nface was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been\r\nill in one way or another. Her father had held a position under the\r\nEnglish Government and had always been busy and ill himself, and her\r\nmother had been a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and\r\namuse herself with gay people. She had not wanted a little girl at all,\r\nand when Mary was born she handed her over to the care of an Ayah, who\r\nwas made to understand that if she wished to please the Mem Sahib she\r\nmust keep the child out of sight as much as possible. So when she was a\r\nsickly, fretful, ugly little baby she was kept out of the way, and when\r\nshe became a sickly, fretful, toddling thing she was kept out of the\r\nway also. She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark\r\nfaces of her Ayah and the other native servants, and as they always\r\nobeyed her and gave her her own way in everything, because the Mem\r\nSahib would be angry if she was disturbed by her crying, by the time\r\nshe was six years old she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as\r\never lived. The young English governess who came to teach her to read\r\nand write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three\r\nmonths, and when other governesses came to try to fill it they always\r\nwent away in a shorter time than the first one. So if Mary had not\r\nchosen to really want to know how to read books she would never have\r\nlearned her letters at all.\r\n\r\nOne frightfully hot morning, when she was about nine years old, she\r\nawakened feeling very cross, and she became crosser still when she saw\r\nthat the servant who stood by her bedside was not her Ayah.\r\n\r\n“Why did you come?” she said to the strange woman. “I will not let you\r\nstay. Send my Ayah to me.”\r\n\r\nThe woman looked frightened, but she only stammered that the Ayah could\r\nnot come and when Mary threw herself into a passion and beat and kicked\r\nher, she looked only more frightened and repeated that it was not\r\npossible for the Ayah to come to Missie Sahib.\r\n\r\nThere was something mysterious in the air that morning. Nothing was\r\ndone in its regular order and several of the native servants seemed\r\nmissing, while those whom Mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and\r\nscared faces. But no one would tell her anything and her Ayah did not\r\ncome. She was actually left alone as the morning went on, and at last\r\nshe wandered out into the garden and began to play by herself under a\r\ntree near the veranda. She pretended that she was making a flower-bed,\r\nand she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth,\r\nall the time growing more and more angry and muttering to herself the\r\nthings she would say and the names she would call Saidie when she\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n“Pig! Pig! Daughter of Pigs!” she said, because to call a native a pig\r\nis the worst insult of all.\r\n\r\nShe was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when she\r\nheard her mother come out on the veranda with someone. She was with a\r\nfair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices.\r\nMary knew the fair young man who looked like a boy. She had heard that\r\nhe was a very young officer who had just come from England. The child\r\nstared at him, but she stared most at her mother. She always did this\r\nwhen she had a chance to see her, because the Mem Sahib—Mary used to\r\ncall her that oftener than anything else—was such a tall, slim, pretty\r\nperson and wore such lovely clothes. Her hair was like curly silk and\r\nshe had a delicate little nose which seemed to be disdaining things,\r\nand she had large laughing eyes. All her clothes were thin and\r\nfloating, and Mary said they were “full of lace.” They looked fuller of\r\nlace than ever this morning, but her eyes were not laughing at all.\r\nThey were large and scared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy\r\nofficer’s face.\r\n\r\n“Is it so very bad? Oh, is it?” Mary heard her say.\r\n\r\n“Awfully,” the young man answered in a trembling voice. “Awfully, Mrs.\r\nLennox. You ought to have gone to the hills two weeks ago.”\r\n\r\nThe Mem Sahib wrung her hands.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I know I ought!” she cried. “I only stayed to go to that silly\r\ndinner party. What a fool I was!”\r\n\r\nAt that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke out from the\r\nservants’ quarters that she clutched the young man’s arm, and Mary\r\nstood shivering from head to foot. The wailing grew wilder and wilder.\r\n“What is it? What is it?” Mrs. Lennox gasped.\r\n\r\n“Someone has died,” answered the boy officer. “You did not say it had\r\nbroken out among your servants.”\r\n\r\n“I did not know!” the Mem Sahib cried. “Come with me! Come with me!”\r\nand she turned and ran into the house.\r\n\r\nAfter that appalling things happened, and the mysteriousness of the\r\nmorning was explained to Mary. The cholera had broken out in its most\r\nfatal form and people were dying like flies. The Ayah had been taken\r\nill in the night, and it was because she had just died that the\r\nservants had wailed in the huts. Before the next day three other\r\nservants were dead and others had run away in terror. There was panic\r\non every side, and dying people in all the bungalows.\r\n\r\nDuring the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary hid\r\nherself in the nursery and was forgotten by everyone. Nobody thought of\r\nher, nobody wanted her, and strange things happened of which she knew\r\nnothing. Mary alternately cried and slept through the hours. She only\r\nknew that people were ill and that she heard mysterious and frightening\r\nsounds. Once she crept into the dining-room and found it empty, though\r\na partly finished meal was on the table and chairs and plates looked as\r\nif they had been hastily pushed back when the diners rose suddenly for\r\nsome reason. The child ate some fruit and biscuits, and being thirsty\r\nshe drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled. It was sweet, and\r\nshe did not know how strong it was. Very soon it made her intensely\r\ndrowsy, and she went back to her nursery and shut herself in again,\r\nfrightened by cries she heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound of\r\nfeet. The wine made her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her eyes\r\nopen and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing more for a long time.\r\n\r\nMany things happened during the hours in which she slept so heavily,\r\nbut she was not disturbed by the wails and the sound of things being\r\ncarried in and out of the bungalow.\r\n\r\nWhen she awakened she lay and stared at the wall. The house was\r\nperfectly still. She had never known it to be so silent before. She\r\nheard neither voices nor footsteps, and wondered if everybody had got\r\nwell of the cholera and all the trouble was over. She wondered also who\r\nwould take care of her now her Ayah was dead. There would be a new\r\nAyah, and perhaps she would know some new stories. Mary had been rather\r\ntired of the old ones. She did not cry because her nurse had died. She\r\nwas not an affectionate child and had never cared much for anyone. The\r\nnoise and hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had frightened\r\nher, and she had been angry because no one seemed to remember that she\r\nwas alive. Everyone was too panic-stricken to think of a little girl no\r\none was fond of. When people had the cholera it seemed that they\r\nremembered nothing but themselves. But if everyone had got well again,\r\nsurely someone would remember and come to look for her.\r\n\r\nBut no one came, and as she lay waiting the house seemed to grow more\r\nand more silent. She heard something rustling on the matting and when\r\nshe looked down she saw a little snake gliding along and watching her\r\nwith eyes like jewels. She was not frightened, because he was a\r\nharmless little thing who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry\r\nto get out of the room. He slipped under the door as she watched him.\r\n\r\n“How queer and quiet it is,” she said. “It sounds as if there were no\r\none in the bungalow but me and the snake.”\r\n\r\nAlmost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound, and then on\r\nthe veranda. They were men’s footsteps, and the men entered the\r\nbungalow and talked in low voices. No one went to meet or speak to them\r\nand they seemed to open doors and look into rooms.\r\n\r\n“What desolation!” she heard one voice say. “That pretty, pretty woman!\r\nI suppose the child, too. I heard there was a child, though no one ever\r\nsaw her.”\r\n\r\nMary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the\r\ndoor a few minutes later. She looked an ugly, cross little thing and\r\nwas frowning because she was beginning to be hungry and feel\r\ndisgracefully neglected. The first man who came in was a large officer\r\nshe had once seen talking to her father. He looked tired and troubled,\r\nbut when he saw her he was so startled that he almost jumped back.\r\n\r\n“Barney!” he cried out. “There is a child here! A child alone! In a\r\nplace like this! Mercy on us, who is she!”\r\n\r\n“I am Mary Lennox,” the little girl said, drawing herself up stiffly.\r\nShe thought the man was very rude to call her father’s bungalow “A\r\nplace like this!” “I fell asleep when everyone had the cholera and I\r\nhave only just wakened up. Why does nobody come?”\r\n\r\n“It is the child no one ever saw!” exclaimed the man, turning to his\r\ncompanions. “She has actually been forgotten!”\r\n\r\n“Why was I forgotten?” Mary said, stamping her foot. “Why does nobody\r\ncome?”\r\n\r\nThe young man whose name was Barney looked at her very sadly. Mary even\r\nthought she saw him wink his eyes as if to wink tears away.\r\n\r\n“Poor little kid!” he said. “There is nobody left to come.”\r\n\r\nIt was in that strange and sudden way that Mary found out that she had\r\nneither father nor mother left; that they had died and been carried\r\naway in the night, and that the few native servants who had not died\r\nalso had left the house as quickly as they could get out of it, none of\r\nthem even remembering that there was a Missie Sahib. That was why the\r\nplace was so quiet. It was true that there was no one in the bungalow\r\nbut herself and the little rustling snake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nMISTRESS MARY QUITE CONTRARY\r\n\r\n\r\nMary had liked to look at her mother from a distance and she had\r\nthought her very pretty, but as she knew very little of her she could\r\nscarcely have been expected to love her or to miss her very much when\r\nshe was gone. She did not miss her at all, in fact, and as she was a\r\nself-absorbed child she gave her entire thought to herself, as she had\r\nalways done. If she had been older she would no doubt have been very\r\nanxious at being left alone in the world, but she was very young, and\r\nas she had always been taken care of, she supposed she always would be.\r\nWhat she thought was that she would like to know if she was going to\r\nnice people, who would be polite to her and give her her own way as her\r\nAyah and the other native servants had done.\r\n\r\nShe knew that she was not going to stay at the English clergyman’s\r\nhouse where she was taken at first. She did not want to stay. The\r\nEnglish clergyman was poor and he had five children nearly all the same\r\nage and they wore shabby clothes and were always quarreling and\r\nsnatching toys from each other. Mary hated their untidy bungalow and\r\nwas so disagreeable to them that after the first day or two nobody\r\nwould play with her. By the second day they had given her a nickname\r\nwhich made her furious.\r\n\r\nIt was Basil who thought of it first. Basil was a little boy with\r\nimpudent blue eyes and a turned-up nose, and Mary hated him. She was\r\nplaying by herself under a tree, just as she had been playing the day\r\nthe cholera broke out. She was making heaps of earth and paths for a\r\ngarden and Basil came and stood near to watch her. Presently he got\r\nrather interested and suddenly made a suggestion.\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you put a heap of stones there and pretend it is a rockery?”\r\nhe said. “There in the middle,” and he leaned over her to point.\r\n\r\n“Go away!” cried Mary. “I don’t want boys. Go away!”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Basil looked angry, and then he began to tease. He was\r\nalways teasing his sisters. He danced round and round her and made\r\nfaces and sang and laughed.\r\n\r\n“Mistress Mary, quite contrary,\r\n    How does your garden grow?\r\nWith silver bells, and cockle shells,\r\n    And marigolds all in a row.”\r\n\r\nHe sang it until the other children heard and laughed, too; and the\r\ncrosser Mary got, the more they sang “Mistress Mary, quite contrary”;\r\nand after that as long as she stayed with them they called her\r\n“Mistress Mary Quite Contrary” when they spoke of her to each other,\r\nand often when they spoke to her.\r\n\r\n“You are going to be sent home,” Basil said to her, “at the end of the\r\nweek. And we’re glad of it.”\r\n\r\n“I am glad of it, too,” answered Mary. “Where is home?”\r\n\r\n“She doesn’t know where home is!” said Basil, with seven-year-old\r\nscorn. “It’s England, of course. Our grandmama lives there and our\r\nsister Mabel was sent to her last year. You are not going to your\r\ngrandmama. You have none. You are going to your uncle. His name is Mr.\r\nArchibald Craven.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know anything about him,” snapped Mary.\r\n\r\n“I know you don’t,” Basil answered. “You don’t know anything. Girls\r\nnever do. I heard father and mother talking about him. He lives in a\r\ngreat, big, desolate old house in the country and no one goes near him.\r\nHe’s so cross he won’t let them, and they wouldn’t come if he would let\r\nthem. He’s a hunchback, and he’s horrid.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe you,” said Mary; and she turned her back and stuck her\r\nfingers in her ears, because she would not listen any more.\r\n\r\nBut she thought over it a great deal afterward; and when Mrs. Crawford\r\ntold her that night that she was going to sail away to England in a few\r\ndays and go to her uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven, who lived at\r\nMisselthwaite Manor, she looked so stony and stubbornly uninterested\r\nthat they did not know what to think about her. They tried to be kind\r\nto her, but she only turned her face away when Mrs. Crawford attempted\r\nto kiss her, and held herself stiffly when Mr. Crawford patted her\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n“She is such a plain child,” Mrs. Crawford said pityingly, afterward.\r\n“And her mother was such a pretty creature. She had a very pretty\r\nmanner, too, and Mary has the most unattractive ways I ever saw in a\r\nchild. The children call her ‘Mistress Mary Quite Contrary,’ and though\r\nit’s naughty of them, one can’t help understanding it.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps if her mother had carried her pretty face and her pretty\r\nmanners oftener into the nursery Mary might have learned some pretty\r\nways too. It is very sad, now the poor beautiful thing is gone, to\r\nremember that many people never even knew that she had a child at all.”\r\n\r\n“I believe she scarcely ever looked at her,” sighed Mrs. Crawford.\r\n“When her Ayah was dead there was no one to give a thought to the\r\nlittle thing. Think of the servants running away and leaving her all\r\nalone in that deserted bungalow. Colonel McGrew said he nearly jumped\r\nout of his skin when he opened the door and found her standing by\r\nherself in the middle of the room.”\r\n\r\nMary made the long voyage to England under the care of an officer’s\r\nwife, who was taking her children to leave them in a boarding-school.\r\nShe was very much absorbed in her own little boy and girl, and was\r\nrather glad to hand the child over to the woman Mr. Archibald Craven\r\nsent to meet her, in London. The woman was his housekeeper at\r\nMisselthwaite Manor, and her name was Mrs. Medlock. She was a stout\r\nwoman, with very red cheeks and sharp black eyes. She wore a very\r\npurple dress, a black silk mantle with jet fringe on it and a black\r\nbonnet with purple velvet flowers which stuck up and trembled when she\r\nmoved her head. Mary did not like her at all, but as she very seldom\r\nliked people there was nothing remarkable in that; besides which it was\r\nvery evident Mrs. Medlock did not think much of her.\r\n\r\n“My word! she’s a plain little piece of goods!” she said. “And we’d\r\nheard that her mother was a beauty. She hasn’t handed much of it down,\r\nhas she, ma’am?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps she will improve as she grows older,” the officer’s wife said\r\ngood-naturedly. “If she were not so sallow and had a nicer expression,\r\nher features are rather good. Children alter so much.”\r\n\r\n“She’ll have to alter a good deal,” answered Mrs. Medlock. “And,\r\nthere’s nothing likely to improve children at Misselthwaite—if you ask\r\nme!”\r\n\r\nThey thought Mary was not listening because she was standing a little\r\napart from them at the window of the private hotel they had gone to.\r\nShe was watching the passing buses and cabs and people, but she heard\r\nquite well and was made very curious about her uncle and the place he\r\nlived in. What sort of a place was it, and what would he be like? What\r\nwas a hunchback? She had never seen one. Perhaps there were none in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nSince she had been living in other people’s houses and had had no Ayah,\r\nshe had begun to feel lonely and to think queer thoughts which were new\r\nto her. She had begun to wonder why she had never seemed to belong to\r\nanyone even when her father and mother had been alive. Other children\r\nseemed to belong to their fathers and mothers, but she had never seemed\r\nto really be anyone’s little girl. She had had servants, and food and\r\nclothes, but no one had taken any notice of her. She did not know that\r\nthis was because she was a disagreeable child; but then, of course, she\r\ndid not know she was disagreeable. She often thought that other people\r\nwere, but she did not know that she was so herself.\r\n\r\nShe thought Mrs. Medlock the most disagreeable person she had ever\r\nseen, with her common, highly colored face and her common fine bonnet.\r\nWhen the next day they set out on their journey to Yorkshire, she\r\nwalked through the station to the railway carriage with her head up and\r\ntrying to keep as far away from her as she could, because she did not\r\nwant to seem to belong to her. It would have made her angry to think\r\npeople imagined she was her little girl.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Medlock was not in the least disturbed by her and her\r\nthoughts. She was the kind of woman who would “stand no nonsense from\r\nyoung ones.” At least, that is what she would have said if she had been\r\nasked. She had not wanted to go to London just when her sister Maria’s\r\ndaughter was going to be married, but she had a comfortable, well paid\r\nplace as housekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor and the only way in which\r\nshe could keep it was to do at once what Mr. Archibald Craven told her\r\nto do. She never dared even to ask a question.\r\n\r\n“Captain Lennox and his wife died of the cholera,” Mr. Craven had said\r\nin his short, cold way. “Captain Lennox was my wife’s brother and I am\r\ntheir daughter’s guardian. The child is to be brought here. You must go\r\nto London and bring her yourself.”\r\n\r\nSo she packed her small trunk and made the journey.\r\n\r\nMary sat in her corner of the railway carriage and looked plain and\r\nfretful. She had nothing to read or to look at, and she had folded her\r\nthin little black-gloved hands in her lap. Her black dress made her\r\nlook yellower than ever, and her limp light hair straggled from under\r\nher black crêpe hat.\r\n\r\n“A more marred-looking young one I never saw in my life,” Mrs. Medlock\r\nthought. (Marred is a Yorkshire word and means spoiled and pettish.)\r\nShe had never seen a child who sat so still without doing anything; and\r\nat last she got tired of watching her and began to talk in a brisk,\r\nhard voice.\r\n\r\n“I suppose I may as well tell you something about where you are going\r\nto,” she said. “Do you know anything about your uncle?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Mary.\r\n\r\n“Never heard your father and mother talk about him?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Mary frowning. She frowned because she remembered that her\r\nfather and mother had never talked to her about anything in particular.\r\nCertainly they had never told her things.\r\n\r\n“Humph,” muttered Mrs. Medlock, staring at her queer, unresponsive\r\nlittle face. She did not say any more for a few moments and then she\r\nbegan again.\r\n\r\n“I suppose you might as well be told something—to prepare you. You are\r\ngoing to a queer place.”\r\n\r\nMary said nothing at all, and Mrs. Medlock looked rather discomfited by\r\nher apparent indifference, but, after taking a breath, she went on.\r\n\r\n“Not but that it’s a grand big place in a gloomy way, and Mr. Craven’s\r\nproud of it in his way—and that’s gloomy enough, too. The house is six\r\nhundred years old and it’s on the edge of the moor, and there’s near a\r\nhundred rooms in it, though most of them’s shut up and locked. And\r\nthere’s pictures and fine old furniture and things that’s been there\r\nfor ages, and there’s a big park round it and gardens and trees with\r\nbranches trailing to the ground—some of them.” She paused and took\r\nanother breath. “But there’s nothing else,” she ended suddenly.\r\n\r\nMary had begun to listen in spite of herself. It all sounded so unlike\r\nIndia, and anything new rather attracted her. But she did not intend to\r\nlook as if she were interested. That was one of her unhappy,\r\ndisagreeable ways. So she sat still.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Mrs. Medlock. “What do you think of it?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing,” she answered. “I know nothing about such places.”\r\n\r\nThat made Mrs. Medlock laugh a short sort of laugh.\r\n\r\n“Eh!” she said, “but you are like an old woman. Don’t you care?”\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t matter” said Mary, “whether I care or not.”\r\n\r\n“You are right enough there,” said Mrs. Medlock. “It doesn’t. What\r\nyou’re to be kept at Misselthwaite Manor for I don’t know, unless\r\nbecause it’s the easiest way. _He’s_ not going to trouble himself about\r\nyou, that’s sure and certain. He never troubles himself about no one.”\r\n\r\nShe stopped herself as if she had just remembered something in time.\r\n\r\n“He’s got a crooked back,” she said. “That set him wrong. He was a sour\r\nyoung man and got no good of all his money and big place till he was\r\nmarried.”\r\n\r\nMary’s eyes turned toward her in spite of her intention not to seem to\r\ncare. She had never thought of the hunchback’s being married and she\r\nwas a trifle surprised. Mrs. Medlock saw this, and as she was a\r\ntalkative woman she continued with more interest. This was one way of\r\npassing some of the time, at any rate.\r\n\r\n“She was a sweet, pretty thing and he’d have walked the world over to\r\nget her a blade o’ grass she wanted. Nobody thought she’d marry him,\r\nbut she did, and people said she married him for his money. But she\r\ndidn’t—she didn’t,” positively. “When she died—”\r\n\r\nMary gave a little involuntary jump.\r\n\r\n“Oh! did she die!” she exclaimed, quite without meaning to. She had\r\njust remembered a French fairy story she had once read called “Riquet à\r\nla Houppe.” It had been about a poor hunchback and a beautiful princess\r\nand it had made her suddenly sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven.\r\n\r\n“Yes, she died,” Mrs. Medlock answered. “And it made him queerer than\r\never. He cares about nobody. He won’t see people. Most of the time he\r\ngoes away, and when he is at Misselthwaite he shuts himself up in the\r\nWest Wing and won’t let anyone but Pitcher see him. Pitcher’s an old\r\nfellow, but he took care of him when he was a child and he knows his\r\nways.”\r\n\r\nIt sounded like something in a book and it did not make Mary feel\r\ncheerful. A house with a hundred rooms, nearly all shut up and with\r\ntheir doors locked—a house on the edge of a moor—whatsoever a moor\r\nwas—sounded dreary. A man with a crooked back who shut himself up also!\r\nShe stared out of the window with her lips pinched together, and it\r\nseemed quite natural that the rain should have begun to pour down in\r\ngray slanting lines and splash and stream down the window-panes. If the\r\npretty wife had been alive she might have made things cheerful by being\r\nsomething like her own mother and by running in and out and going to\r\nparties as she had done in frocks “full of lace.” But she was not there\r\nany more.\r\n\r\n“You needn’t expect to see him, because ten to one you won’t,” said\r\nMrs. Medlock. “And you mustn’t expect that there will be people to talk\r\nto you. You’ll have to play about and look after yourself. You’ll be\r\ntold what rooms you can go into and what rooms you’re to keep out of.\r\nThere’s gardens enough. But when you’re in the house don’t go wandering\r\nand poking about. Mr. Craven won’t have it.”\r\n\r\n“I shall not want to go poking about,” said sour little Mary and just\r\nas suddenly as she had begun to be rather sorry for Mr. Archibald\r\nCraven she began to cease to be sorry and to think he was unpleasant\r\nenough to deserve all that had happened to him.\r\n\r\nAnd she turned her face toward the streaming panes of the window of the\r\nrailway carriage and gazed out at the gray rain-storm which looked as\r\nif it would go on forever and ever. She watched it so long and steadily\r\nthat the grayness grew heavier and heavier before her eyes and she fell\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nACROSS THE MOOR\r\n\r\n\r\nShe slept a long time, and when she awakened Mrs. Medlock had bought a\r\nlunchbasket at one of the stations and they had some chicken and cold\r\nbeef and bread and butter and some hot tea. The rain seemed to be\r\nstreaming down more heavily than ever and everybody in the station wore\r\nwet and glistening waterproofs. The guard lighted the lamps in the\r\ncarriage, and Mrs. Medlock cheered up very much over her tea and\r\nchicken and beef. She ate a great deal and afterward fell asleep\r\nherself, and Mary sat and stared at her and watched her fine bonnet\r\nslip on one side until she herself fell asleep once more in the corner\r\nof the carriage, lulled by the splashing of the rain against the\r\nwindows. It was quite dark when she awakened again. The train had\r\nstopped at a station and Mrs. Medlock was shaking her.\r\n\r\n“You have had a sleep!” she said. “It’s time to open your eyes! We’re\r\nat Thwaite Station and we’ve got a long drive before us.”\r\n\r\nMary stood up and tried to keep her eyes open while Mrs. Medlock\r\ncollected her parcels. The little girl did not offer to help her,\r\nbecause in India native servants always picked up or carried things and\r\nit seemed quite proper that other people should wait on one.\r\n\r\nThe station was a small one and nobody but themselves seemed to be\r\ngetting out of the train. The station-master spoke to Mrs. Medlock in a\r\nrough, good-natured way, pronouncing his words in a queer broad fashion\r\nwhich Mary found out afterward was Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n“I see tha’s got back,” he said. “An’ tha’s browt th’ young ’un with\r\nthee.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, that’s her,” answered Mrs. Medlock, speaking with a Yorkshire\r\naccent herself and jerking her head over her shoulder toward Mary.\r\n“How’s thy Missus?”\r\n\r\n“Well enow. Th’ carriage is waitin’ outside for thee.”\r\n\r\nA brougham stood on the road before the little outside platform. Mary\r\nsaw that it was a smart carriage and that it was a smart footman who\r\nhelped her in. His long waterproof coat and the waterproof covering of\r\nhis hat were shining and dripping with rain as everything was, the\r\nburly station-master included.\r\n\r\nWhen he shut the door, mounted the box with the coachman, and they\r\ndrove off, the little girl found herself seated in a comfortably\r\ncushioned corner, but she was not inclined to go to sleep again. She\r\nsat and looked out of the window, curious to see something of the road\r\nover which she was being driven to the queer place Mrs. Medlock had\r\nspoken of. She was not at all a timid child and she was not exactly\r\nfrightened, but she felt that there was no knowing what might happen in\r\na house with a hundred rooms nearly all shut up—a house standing on the\r\nedge of a moor.\r\n\r\n“What is a moor?” she said suddenly to Mrs. Medlock.\r\n\r\n“Look out of the window in about ten minutes and you’ll see,” the woman\r\nanswered. “We’ve got to drive five miles across Missel Moor before we\r\nget to the Manor. You won’t see much because it’s a dark night, but you\r\ncan see something.”\r\n\r\nMary asked no more questions but waited in the darkness of her corner,\r\nkeeping her eyes on the window. The carriage lamps cast rays of light a\r\nlittle distance ahead of them and she caught glimpses of the things\r\nthey passed. After they had left the station they had driven through a\r\ntiny village and she had seen whitewashed cottages and the lights of a\r\npublic house. Then they had passed a church and a vicarage and a little\r\nshop-window or so in a cottage with toys and sweets and odd things set\r\nout for sale. Then they were on the highroad and she saw hedges and\r\ntrees. After that there seemed nothing different for a long time—or at\r\nleast it seemed a long time to her.\r\n\r\nAt last the horses began to go more slowly, as if they were climbing\r\nup-hill, and presently there seemed to be no more hedges and no more\r\ntrees. She could see nothing, in fact, but a dense darkness on either\r\nside. She leaned forward and pressed her face against the window just\r\nas the carriage gave a big jolt.\r\n\r\n“Eh! We’re on the moor now sure enough,” said Mrs. Medlock.\r\n\r\nThe carriage lamps shed a yellow light on a rough-looking road which\r\nseemed to be cut through bushes and low-growing things which ended in\r\nthe great expanse of dark apparently spread out before and around them.\r\nA wind was rising and making a singular, wild, low, rushing sound.\r\n\r\n“It’s—it’s not the sea, is it?” said Mary, looking round at her\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n“No, not it,” answered Mrs. Medlock. “Nor it isn’t fields nor\r\nmountains, it’s just miles and miles and miles of wild land that\r\nnothing grows on but heather and gorse and broom, and nothing lives on\r\nbut wild ponies and sheep.”\r\n\r\n“I feel as if it might be the sea, if there were water on it,” said\r\nMary. “It sounds like the sea just now.”\r\n\r\n“That’s the wind blowing through the bushes,” Mrs. Medlock said. “It’s\r\na wild, dreary enough place to my mind, though there’s plenty that\r\nlikes it—particularly when the heather’s in bloom.”\r\n\r\nOn and on they drove through the darkness, and though the rain stopped,\r\nthe wind rushed by and whistled and made strange sounds. The road went\r\nup and down, and several times the carriage passed over a little bridge\r\nbeneath which water rushed very fast with a great deal of noise. Mary\r\nfelt as if the drive would never come to an end and that the wide,\r\nbleak moor was a wide expanse of black ocean through which she was\r\npassing on a strip of dry land.\r\n\r\n“I don’t like it,” she said to herself. “I don’t like it,” and she\r\npinched her thin lips more tightly together.\r\n\r\nThe horses were climbing up a hilly piece of road when she first caught\r\nsight of a light. Mrs. Medlock saw it as soon as she did and drew a\r\nlong sigh of relief.\r\n\r\n“Eh, I am glad to see that bit o’ light twinkling,” she exclaimed.\r\n“It’s the light in the lodge window. We shall get a good cup of tea\r\nafter a bit, at all events.”\r\n\r\nIt was “after a bit,” as she said, for when the carriage passed through\r\nthe park gates there was still two miles of avenue to drive through and\r\nthe trees (which nearly met overhead) made it seem as if they were\r\ndriving through a long dark vault.\r\n\r\nThey drove out of the vault into a clear space and stopped before an\r\nimmensely long but low-built house which seemed to ramble round a stone\r\ncourt. At first Mary thought that there were no lights at all in the\r\nwindows, but as she got out of the carriage she saw that one room in a\r\ncorner upstairs showed a dull glow.\r\n\r\nThe entrance door was a huge one made of massive, curiously shaped\r\npanels of oak studded with big iron nails and bound with great iron\r\nbars. It opened into an enormous hall, which was so dimly lighted that\r\nthe faces in the portraits on the walls and the figures in the suits of\r\narmor made Mary feel that she did not want to look at them. As she\r\nstood on the stone floor she looked a very small, odd little black\r\nfigure, and she felt as small and lost and odd as she looked.\r\n\r\nA neat, thin old man stood near the manservant who opened the door for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“You are to take her to her room,” he said in a husky voice. “He\r\ndoesn’t want to see her. He’s going to London in the morning.”\r\n\r\n“Very well, Mr. Pitcher,” Mrs. Medlock answered. “So long as I know\r\nwhat’s expected of me, I can manage.”\r\n\r\n“What’s expected of you, Mrs. Medlock,” Mr. Pitcher said, “is that you\r\nmake sure that he’s not disturbed and that he doesn’t see what he\r\ndoesn’t want to see.”\r\n\r\nAnd then Mary Lennox was led up a broad staircase and down a long\r\ncorridor and up a short flight of steps and through another corridor\r\nand another, until a door opened in a wall and she found herself in a\r\nroom with a fire in it and a supper on a table.\r\n\r\nMrs. Medlock said unceremoniously:\r\n\r\n“Well, here you are! This room and the next are where you’ll live—and\r\nyou must keep to them. Don’t you forget that!”\r\n\r\nIt was in this way Mistress Mary arrived at Misselthwaite Manor and she\r\nhad perhaps never felt quite so contrary in all her life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nMARTHA\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen she opened her eyes in the morning it was because a young\r\nhousemaid had come into her room to light the fire and was kneeling on\r\nthe hearth-rug raking out the cinders noisily. Mary lay and watched her\r\nfor a few moments and then began to look about the room. She had never\r\nseen a room at all like it and thought it curious and gloomy. The walls\r\nwere covered with tapestry with a forest scene embroidered on it. There\r\nwere fantastically dressed people under the trees and in the distance\r\nthere was a glimpse of the turrets of a castle. There were hunters and\r\nhorses and dogs and ladies. Mary felt as if she were in the forest with\r\nthem. Out of a deep window she could see a great climbing stretch of\r\nland which seemed to have no trees on it, and to look rather like an\r\nendless, dull, purplish sea.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” she said, pointing out of the window.\r\n\r\nMartha, the young housemaid, who had just risen to her feet, looked and\r\npointed also.\r\n\r\n“That there?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“That’s th’ moor,” with a good-natured grin. “Does tha’ like it?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Mary. “I hate it.”\r\n\r\n“That’s because tha’rt not used to it,” Martha said, going back to her\r\nhearth. “Tha’ thinks it’s too big an’ bare now. But tha’ will like it.”\r\n\r\n“Do you?” inquired Mary.\r\n\r\n“Aye, that I do,” answered Martha, cheerfully polishing away at the\r\ngrate. “I just love it. It’s none bare. It’s covered wi’ growin’ things\r\nas smells sweet. It’s fair lovely in spring an’ summer when th’ gorse\r\nan’ broom an’ heather’s in flower. It smells o’ honey an’ there’s such\r\na lot o’ fresh air—an’ th’ sky looks so high an’ th’ bees an’ skylarks\r\nmakes such a nice noise hummin’ an’ singin’. Eh! I wouldn’t live away\r\nfrom th’ moor for anythin’.”\r\n\r\nMary listened to her with a grave, puzzled expression. The native\r\nservants she had been used to in India were not in the least like this.\r\nThey were obsequious and servile and did not presume to talk to their\r\nmasters as if they were their equals. They made salaams and called them\r\n“protector of the poor” and names of that sort. Indian servants were\r\ncommanded to do things, not asked. It was not the custom to say\r\n“please” and “thank you” and Mary had always slapped her Ayah in the\r\nface when she was angry. She wondered a little what this girl would do\r\nif one slapped her in the face. She was a round, rosy, good-natured\r\nlooking creature, but she had a sturdy way which made Mistress Mary\r\nwonder if she might not even slap back—if the person who slapped her\r\nwas only a little girl.\r\n\r\n“You are a strange servant,” she said from her pillows, rather\r\nhaughtily.\r\n\r\nMartha sat up on her heels, with her blacking-brush in her hand, and\r\nlaughed, without seeming the least out of temper.\r\n\r\n“Eh! I know that,” she said. “If there was a grand Missus at\r\nMisselthwaite I should never have been even one of th’ under\r\nhousemaids. I might have been let to be scullerymaid but I’d never have\r\nbeen let upstairs. I’m too common an’ I talk too much Yorkshire. But\r\nthis is a funny house for all it’s so grand. Seems like there’s neither\r\nMaster nor Mistress except Mr. Pitcher an’ Mrs. Medlock. Mr. Craven, he\r\nwon’t be troubled about anythin’ when he’s here, an’ he’s nearly always\r\naway. Mrs. Medlock gave me th’ place out o’ kindness. She told me she\r\ncould never have done it if Misselthwaite had been like other big\r\nhouses.”\r\n\r\n“Are you going to be my servant?” Mary asked, still in her imperious\r\nlittle Indian way.\r\n\r\nMartha began to rub her grate again.\r\n\r\n“I’m Mrs. Medlock’s servant,” she said stoutly. “An’ she’s Mr.\r\nCraven’s—but I’m to do the housemaid’s work up here an’ wait on you a\r\nbit. But you won’t need much waitin’ on.”\r\n\r\n“Who is going to dress me?” demanded Mary.\r\n\r\nMartha sat up on her heels again and stared. She spoke in broad\r\nYorkshire in her amazement.\r\n\r\n“Canna’ tha’ dress thysen!” she said.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean? I don’t understand your language,” said Mary.\r\n\r\n“Eh! I forgot,” Martha said. “Mrs. Medlock told me I’d have to be\r\ncareful or you wouldn’t know what I was sayin’. I mean can’t you put on\r\nyour own clothes?”\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Mary, quite indignantly. “I never did in my life. My\r\nAyah dressed me, of course.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Martha, evidently not in the least aware that she was\r\nimpudent, “it’s time tha’ should learn. Tha’ cannot begin younger.\r\nIt’ll do thee good to wait on thysen a bit. My mother always said she\r\ncouldn’t see why grand people’s children didn’t turn out fair\r\nfools—what with nurses an’ bein’ washed an’ dressed an’ took out to\r\nwalk as if they was puppies!”\r\n\r\n“It is different in India,” said Mistress Mary disdainfully. She could\r\nscarcely stand this.\r\n\r\nBut Martha was not at all crushed.\r\n\r\n“Eh! I can see it’s different,” she answered almost sympathetically. “I\r\ndare say it’s because there’s such a lot o’ blacks there instead o’\r\nrespectable white people. When I heard you was comin’ from India I\r\nthought you was a black too.”\r\n\r\nMary sat up in bed furious.\r\n\r\n“What!” she said. “What! You thought I was a native. You—you daughter\r\nof a pig!”\r\n\r\nMartha stared and looked hot.\r\n\r\n“Who are you callin’ names?” she said. “You needn’t be so vexed. That’s\r\nnot th’ way for a young lady to talk. I’ve nothin’ against th’ blacks.\r\nWhen you read about ’em in tracts they’re always very religious. You\r\nalways read as a black’s a man an’ a brother. I’ve never seen a black\r\nan’ I was fair pleased to think I was goin’ to see one close. When I\r\ncome in to light your fire this mornin’ I crep’ up to your bed an’\r\npulled th’ cover back careful to look at you. An’ there you was,”\r\ndisappointedly, “no more black than me—for all you’re so yeller.”\r\n\r\nMary did not even try to control her rage and humiliation.\r\n\r\n“You thought I was a native! You dared! You don’t know anything about\r\nnatives! They are not people—they’re servants who must salaam to you.\r\nYou know nothing about India. You know nothing about anything!”\r\n\r\nShe was in such a rage and felt so helpless before the girl’s simple\r\nstare, and somehow she suddenly felt so horribly lonely and far away\r\nfrom everything she understood and which understood her, that she threw\r\nherself face downward on the pillows and burst into passionate sobbing.\r\nShe sobbed so unrestrainedly that good-natured Yorkshire Martha was a\r\nlittle frightened and quite sorry for her. She went to the bed and bent\r\nover her.\r\n\r\n“Eh! you mustn’t cry like that there!” she begged. “You mustn’t for\r\nsure. I didn’t know you’d be vexed. I don’t know anythin’ about\r\nanythin’—just like you said. I beg your pardon, Miss. Do stop cryin’.”\r\n\r\nThere was something comforting and really friendly in her queer\r\nYorkshire speech and sturdy way which had a good effect on Mary. She\r\ngradually ceased crying and became quiet. Martha looked relieved.\r\n\r\n“It’s time for thee to get up now,” she said. “Mrs. Medlock said I was\r\nto carry tha’ breakfast an’ tea an’ dinner into th’ room next to this.\r\nIt’s been made into a nursery for thee. I’ll help thee on with thy\r\nclothes if tha’ll get out o’ bed. If th’ buttons are at th’ back tha’\r\ncannot button them up tha’self.”\r\n\r\nWhen Mary at last decided to get up, the clothes Martha took from the\r\nwardrobe were not the ones she had worn when she arrived the night\r\nbefore with Mrs. Medlock.\r\n\r\n“Those are not mine,” she said. “Mine are black.”\r\n\r\nShe looked the thick white wool coat and dress over, and added with\r\ncool approval:\r\n\r\n“Those are nicer than mine.”\r\n\r\n“These are th’ ones tha’ must put on,” Martha answered. “Mr. Craven\r\nordered Mrs. Medlock to get ’em in London. He said ‘I won’t have a\r\nchild dressed in black wanderin’ about like a lost soul,’ he said.\r\n‘It’d make the place sadder than it is. Put color on her.’ Mother she\r\nsaid she knew what he meant. Mother always knows what a body means. She\r\ndoesn’t hold with black hersel’.”\r\n\r\n“I hate black things,” said Mary.\r\n\r\nThe dressing process was one which taught them both something. Martha\r\nhad “buttoned up” her little sisters and brothers but she had never\r\nseen a child who stood still and waited for another person to do things\r\nfor her as if she had neither hands nor feet of her own.\r\n\r\n“Why doesn’t tha’ put on tha’ own shoes?” she said when Mary quietly\r\nheld out her foot.\r\n\r\n“My Ayah did it,” answered Mary, staring. “It was the custom.”\r\n\r\nShe said that very often—“It was the custom.” The native servants were\r\nalways saying it. If one told them to do a thing their ancestors had\r\nnot done for a thousand years they gazed at one mildly and said, “It is\r\nnot the custom” and one knew that was the end of the matter.\r\n\r\nIt had not been the custom that Mistress Mary should do anything but\r\nstand and allow herself to be dressed like a doll, but before she was\r\nready for breakfast she began to suspect that her life at Misselthwaite\r\nManor would end by teaching her a number of things quite new to\r\nher—things such as putting on her own shoes and stockings, and picking\r\nup things she let fall. If Martha had been a well-trained fine young\r\nlady’s maid she would have been more subservient and respectful and\r\nwould have known that it was her business to brush hair, and button\r\nboots, and pick things up and lay them away. She was, however, only an\r\nuntrained Yorkshire rustic who had been brought up in a moorland\r\ncottage with a swarm of little brothers and sisters who had never\r\ndreamed of doing anything but waiting on themselves and on the younger\r\nones who were either babies in arms or just learning to totter about\r\nand tumble over things.\r\n\r\nIf Mary Lennox had been a child who was ready to be amused she would\r\nperhaps have laughed at Martha’s readiness to talk, but Mary only\r\nlistened to her coldly and wondered at her freedom of manner. At first\r\nshe was not at all interested, but gradually, as the girl rattled on in\r\nher good-tempered, homely way, Mary began to notice what she was\r\nsaying.\r\n\r\n“Eh! you should see ’em all,” she said. “There’s twelve of us an’ my\r\nfather only gets sixteen shilling a week. I can tell you my mother’s\r\nput to it to get porridge for ’em all. They tumble about on th’ moor\r\nan’ play there all day an’ mother says th’ air of th’ moor fattens ’em.\r\nShe says she believes they eat th’ grass same as th’ wild ponies do.\r\nOur Dickon, he’s twelve years old and he’s got a young pony he calls\r\nhis own.”\r\n\r\n“Where did he get it?” asked Mary.\r\n\r\n“He found it on th’ moor with its mother when it was a little one an’\r\nhe began to make friends with it an’ give it bits o’ bread an’ pluck\r\nyoung grass for it. And it got to like him so it follows him about an’\r\nit lets him get on its back. Dickon’s a kind lad an’ animals likes\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nMary had never possessed an animal pet of her own and had always\r\nthought she should like one. So she began to feel a slight interest in\r\nDickon, and as she had never before been interested in anyone but\r\nherself, it was the dawning of a healthy sentiment. When she went into\r\nthe room which had been made into a nursery for her, she found that it\r\nwas rather like the one she had slept in. It was not a child’s room,\r\nbut a grown-up person’s room, with gloomy old pictures on the walls and\r\nheavy old oak chairs. A table in the center was set with a good\r\nsubstantial breakfast. But she had always had a very small appetite,\r\nand she looked with something more than indifference at the first plate\r\nMartha set before her.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want it,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Tha’ doesn’t want thy porridge!” Martha exclaimed incredulously.\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Tha’ doesn’t know how good it is. Put a bit o’ treacle on it or a bit\r\no’ sugar.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want it,” repeated Mary.\r\n\r\n“Eh!” said Martha. “I can’t abide to see good victuals go to waste. If\r\nour children was at this table they’d clean it bare in five minutes.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” said Mary coldly.\r\n\r\n“Why!” echoed Martha. “Because they scarce ever had their stomachs full\r\nin their lives. They’re as hungry as young hawks an’ foxes.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what it is to be hungry,” said Mary, with the\r\nindifference of ignorance.\r\n\r\nMartha looked indignant.\r\n\r\n“Well, it would do thee good to try it. I can see that plain enough,”\r\nshe said outspokenly. “I’ve no patience with folk as sits an’ just\r\nstares at good bread an’ meat. My word! don’t I wish Dickon and Phil\r\nan’ Jane an’ th’ rest of ’em had what’s here under their pinafores.”\r\n\r\n“Why don’t you take it to them?” suggested Mary.\r\n\r\n“It’s not mine,” answered Martha stoutly. “An’ this isn’t my day out. I\r\nget my day out once a month same as th’ rest. Then I go home an’ clean\r\nup for mother an’ give her a day’s rest.”\r\n\r\nMary drank some tea and ate a little toast and some marmalade.\r\n\r\n“You wrap up warm an’ run out an’ play you,” said Martha. “It’ll do you\r\ngood and give you some stomach for your meat.”\r\n\r\nMary went to the window. There were gardens and paths and big trees,\r\nbut everything looked dull and wintry.\r\n\r\n“Out? Why should I go out on a day like this?”\r\n\r\n“Well, if tha’ doesn’t go out tha’lt have to stay in, an’ what has tha’\r\ngot to do?”\r\n\r\nMary glanced about her. There was nothing to do. When Mrs. Medlock had\r\nprepared the nursery she had not thought of amusement. Perhaps it would\r\nbe better to go and see what the gardens were like.\r\n\r\n“Who will go with me?” she inquired.\r\n\r\nMartha stared.\r\n\r\n“You’ll go by yourself,” she answered. “You’ll have to learn to play\r\nlike other children does when they haven’t got sisters and brothers.\r\nOur Dickon goes off on th’ moor by himself an’ plays for hours. That’s\r\nhow he made friends with th’ pony. He’s got sheep on th’ moor that\r\nknows him, an’ birds as comes an’ eats out of his hand. However little\r\nthere is to eat, he always saves a bit o’ his bread to coax his pets.”\r\n\r\nIt was really this mention of Dickon which made Mary decide to go out,\r\nthough she was not aware of it. There would be, birds outside though\r\nthere would not be ponies or sheep. They would be different from the\r\nbirds in India and it might amuse her to look at them.\r\n\r\nMartha found her coat and hat for her and a pair of stout little boots\r\nand she showed her her way downstairs.\r\n\r\n“If tha’ goes round that way tha’ll come to th’ gardens,” she said,\r\npointing to a gate in a wall of shrubbery. “There’s lots o’ flowers in\r\nsummer-time, but there’s nothin’ bloomin’ now.” She seemed to hesitate\r\na second before she added, “One of th’ gardens is locked up. No one has\r\nbeen in it for ten years.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked Mary in spite of herself. Here was another locked door\r\nadded to the hundred in the strange house.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Craven had it shut when his wife died so sudden. He won’t let no\r\none go inside. It was her garden. He locked th’ door an’ dug a hole and\r\nburied th’ key. There’s Mrs. Medlock’s bell ringing—I must run.”\r\n\r\nAfter she was gone Mary turned down the walk which led to the door in\r\nthe shrubbery. She could not help thinking about the garden which no\r\none had been into for ten years. She wondered what it would look like\r\nand whether there were any flowers still alive in it. When she had\r\npassed through the shrubbery gate she found herself in great gardens,\r\nwith wide lawns and winding walks with clipped borders. There were\r\ntrees, and flower-beds, and evergreens clipped into strange shapes, and\r\na large pool with an old gray fountain in its midst. But the\r\nflower-beds were bare and wintry and the fountain was not playing. This\r\nwas not the garden which was shut up. How could a garden be shut up?\r\nYou could always walk into a garden.\r\n\r\nShe was just thinking this when she saw that, at the end of the path\r\nshe was following, there seemed to be a long wall, with ivy growing\r\nover it. She was not familiar enough with England to know that she was\r\ncoming upon the kitchen-gardens where the vegetables and fruit were\r\ngrowing. She went toward the wall and found that there was a green door\r\nin the ivy, and that it stood open. This was not the closed garden,\r\nevidently, and she could go into it.\r\n\r\nShe went through the door and found that it was a garden with walls all\r\nround it and that it was only one of several walled gardens which\r\nseemed to open into one another. She saw another open green door,\r\nrevealing bushes and pathways between beds containing winter\r\nvegetables. Fruit-trees were trained flat against the wall, and over\r\nsome of the beds there were glass frames. The place was bare and ugly\r\nenough, Mary thought, as she stood and stared about her. It might be\r\nnicer in summer when things were green, but there was nothing pretty\r\nabout it now.\r\n\r\nPresently an old man with a spade over his shoulder walked through the\r\ndoor leading from the second garden. He looked startled when he saw\r\nMary, and then touched his cap. He had a surly old face, and did not\r\nseem at all pleased to see her—but then she was displeased with his\r\ngarden and wore her “quite contrary” expression, and certainly did not\r\nseem at all pleased to see him.\r\n\r\n“What is this place?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“One o’ th’ kitchen-gardens,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” said Mary, pointing through the other green door.\r\n\r\n“Another of ’em,” shortly. “There’s another on t’other side o’ th’ wall\r\nan’ there’s th’ orchard t’other side o’ that.”\r\n\r\n“Can I go in them?” asked Mary.\r\n\r\n“If tha’ likes. But there’s nowt to see.”\r\n\r\nMary made no response. She went down the path and through the second\r\ngreen door. There, she found more walls and winter vegetables and glass\r\nframes, but in the second wall there was another green door and it was\r\nnot open. Perhaps it led into the garden which no one had seen for ten\r\nyears. As she was not at all a timid child and always did what she\r\nwanted to do, Mary went to the green door and turned the handle. She\r\nhoped the door would not open because she wanted to be sure she had\r\nfound the mysterious garden—but it did open quite easily and she walked\r\nthrough it and found herself in an orchard. There were walls all round\r\nit also and trees trained against them, and there were bare fruit-trees\r\ngrowing in the winter-browned grass—but there was no green door to be\r\nseen anywhere. Mary looked for it, and yet when she had entered the\r\nupper end of the garden she had noticed that the wall did not seem to\r\nend with the orchard but to extend beyond it as if it enclosed a place\r\nat the other side. She could see the tops of trees above the wall, and\r\nwhen she stood still she saw a bird with a bright red breast sitting on\r\nthe topmost branch of one of them, and suddenly he burst into his\r\nwinter song—almost as if he had caught sight of her and was calling to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe stopped and listened to him and somehow his cheerful, friendly\r\nlittle whistle gave her a pleased feeling—even a disagreeable little\r\ngirl may be lonely, and the big closed house and big bare moor and big\r\nbare gardens had made this one feel as if there was no one left in the\r\nworld but herself. If she had been an affectionate child, who had been\r\nused to being loved, she would have broken her heart, but even though\r\nshe was “Mistress Mary Quite Contrary” she was desolate, and the\r\nbright-breasted little bird brought a look into her sour little face\r\nwhich was almost a smile. She listened to him until he flew away. He\r\nwas not like an Indian bird and she liked him and wondered if she\r\nshould ever see him again. Perhaps he lived in the mysterious garden\r\nand knew all about it.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was because she had nothing whatever to do that she thought\r\nso much of the deserted garden. She was curious about it and wanted to\r\nsee what it was like. Why had Mr. Archibald Craven buried the key? If\r\nhe had liked his wife so much why did he hate her garden? She wondered\r\nif she should ever see him, but she knew that if she did she should not\r\nlike him, and he would not like her, and that she should only stand and\r\nstare at him and say nothing, though she should be wanting dreadfully\r\nto ask him why he had done such a queer thing.\r\n\r\n“People never like me and I never like people,” she thought. “And I\r\nnever can talk as the Crawford children could. They were always talking\r\nand laughing and making noises.”\r\n\r\nShe thought of the robin and of the way he seemed to sing his song at\r\nher, and as she remembered the tree-top he perched on she stopped\r\nrather suddenly on the path.\r\n\r\n“I believe that tree was in the secret garden—I feel sure it was,” she\r\nsaid. “There was a wall round the place and there was no door.”\r\n\r\nShe walked back into the first kitchen-garden she had entered and found\r\nthe old man digging there. She went and stood beside him and watched\r\nhim a few moments in her cold little way. He took no notice of her and\r\nso at last she spoke to him.\r\n\r\n“I have been into the other gardens,” she said.\r\n\r\n“There was nothin’ to prevent thee,” he answered crustily.\r\n\r\n“I went into the orchard.”\r\n\r\n“There was no dog at th’ door to bite thee,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“There was no door there into the other garden,” said Mary.\r\n\r\n“What garden?” he said in a rough voice, stopping his digging for a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n“The one on the other side of the wall,” answered Mistress Mary. “There\r\nare trees there—I saw the tops of them. A bird with a red breast was\r\nsitting on one of them and he sang.”\r\n\r\nTo her surprise the surly old weather-beaten face actually changed its\r\nexpression. A slow smile spread over it and the gardener looked quite\r\ndifferent. It made her think that it was curious how much nicer a\r\nperson looked when he smiled. She had not thought of it before.\r\n\r\nHe turned about to the orchard side of his garden and began to\r\nwhistle—a low soft whistle. She could not understand how such a surly\r\nman could make such a coaxing sound.\r\n\r\nAlmost the next moment a wonderful thing happened. She heard a soft\r\nlittle rushing flight through the air—and it was the bird with the red\r\nbreast flying to them, and he actually alighted on the big clod of\r\nearth quite near to the gardener’s foot.\r\n\r\n“Here he is,” chuckled the old man, and then he spoke to the bird as if\r\nhe were speaking to a child.\r\n\r\n“Where has tha’ been, tha’ cheeky little beggar?” he said. “I’ve not\r\nseen thee before today. Has tha begun tha’ courtin’ this early in th’\r\nseason? Tha’rt too forrad.”\r\n\r\nThe bird put his tiny head on one side and looked up at him with his\r\nsoft bright eye which was like a black dewdrop. He seemed quite\r\nfamiliar and not the least afraid. He hopped about and pecked the earth\r\nbriskly, looking for seeds and insects. It actually gave Mary a queer\r\nfeeling in her heart, because he was so pretty and cheerful and seemed\r\nso like a person. He had a tiny plump body and a delicate beak, and\r\nslender delicate legs.\r\n\r\n“Will he always come when you call him?” she asked almost in a whisper.\r\n\r\n“Aye, that he will. I’ve knowed him ever since he was a fledgling. He\r\ncome out of th’ nest in th’ other garden an’ when first he flew over\r\nth’ wall he was too weak to fly back for a few days an’ we got\r\nfriendly. When he went over th’ wall again th’ rest of th’ brood was\r\ngone an’ he was lonely an’ he come back to me.”\r\n\r\n“What kind of a bird is he?” Mary asked.\r\n\r\n“Doesn’t tha’ know? He’s a robin redbreast an’ they’re th’ friendliest,\r\ncuriousest birds alive. They’re almost as friendly as dogs—if you know\r\nhow to get on with ’em. Watch him peckin’ about there an’ lookin’ round\r\nat us now an’ again. He knows we’re talkin’ about him.”\r\n\r\nIt was the queerest thing in the world to see the old fellow. He looked\r\nat the plump little scarlet-waistcoated bird as if he were both proud\r\nand fond of him.\r\n\r\n“He’s a conceited one,” he chuckled. “He likes to hear folk talk about\r\nhim. An’ curious—bless me, there never was his like for curiosity an’\r\nmeddlin’. He’s always comin’ to see what I’m plantin’. He knows all th’\r\nthings Mester Craven never troubles hissel’ to find out. He’s th’ head\r\ngardener, he is.”\r\n\r\nThe robin hopped about busily pecking the soil and now and then stopped\r\nand looked at them a little. Mary thought his black dewdrop eyes gazed\r\nat her with great curiosity. It really seemed as if he were finding out\r\nall about her. The queer feeling in her heart increased.\r\n\r\n“Where did the rest of the brood fly to?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“There’s no knowin’. The old ones turn ’em out o’ their nest an’ make\r\n’em fly an’ they’re scattered before you know it. This one was a\r\nknowin’ one an’ he knew he was lonely.”\r\n\r\nMistress Mary went a step nearer to the robin and looked at him very\r\nhard.\r\n\r\n“I’m lonely,” she said.\r\n\r\nShe had not known before that this was one of the things which made her\r\nfeel sour and cross. She seemed to find it out when the robin looked at\r\nher and she looked at the robin.\r\n\r\nThe old gardener pushed his cap back on his bald head and stared at her\r\na minute.\r\n\r\n“Art tha’ th’ little wench from India?” he asked.\r\n\r\nMary nodded.\r\n\r\n“Then no wonder tha’rt lonely. Tha’lt be lonlier before tha’s done,” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHe began to dig again, driving his spade deep into the rich black\r\ngarden soil while the robin hopped about very busily employed.\r\n\r\n“What is your name?” Mary inquired.\r\n\r\nHe stood up to answer her.\r\n\r\n“Ben Weatherstaff,” he answered, and then he added with a surly\r\nchuckle, “I’m lonely mysel’ except when he’s with me,” and he jerked\r\nhis thumb toward the robin. “He’s th’ only friend I’ve got.”\r\n\r\n“I have no friends at all,” said Mary. “I never had. My Ayah didn’t\r\nlike me and I never played with anyone.”\r\n\r\nIt is a Yorkshire habit to say what you think with blunt frankness, and\r\nold Ben Weatherstaff was a Yorkshire moor man.\r\n\r\n“Tha’ an’ me are a good bit alike,” he said. “We was wove out of th’\r\nsame cloth. We’re neither of us good lookin’ an’ we’re both of us as\r\nsour as we look. We’ve got the same nasty tempers, both of us, I’ll\r\nwarrant.”\r\n\r\nThis was plain speaking, and Mary Lennox had never heard the truth\r\nabout herself in her life. Native servants always salaamed and\r\nsubmitted to you, whatever you did. She had never thought much about\r\nher looks, but she wondered if she was as unattractive as Ben\r\nWeatherstaff and she also wondered if she looked as sour as he had\r\nlooked before the robin came. She actually began to wonder also if she\r\nwas “nasty tempered.” She felt uncomfortable.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a clear rippling little sound broke out near her and she\r\nturned round. She was standing a few feet from a young apple-tree and\r\nthe robin had flown on to one of its branches and had burst out into a\r\nscrap of a song. Ben Weatherstaff laughed outright.\r\n\r\n“What did he do that for?” asked Mary.\r\n\r\n“He’s made up his mind to make friends with thee,” replied Ben. “Dang\r\nme if he hasn’t took a fancy to thee.”\r\n\r\n“To me?” said Mary, and she moved toward the little tree softly and\r\nlooked up.\r\n\r\n“Would you make friends with me?” she said to the robin just as if she\r\nwas speaking to a person. “Would you?” And she did not say it either in\r\nher hard little voice or in her imperious Indian voice, but in a tone\r\nso soft and eager and coaxing that Ben Weatherstaff was as surprised as\r\nshe had been when she heard him whistle.\r\n\r\n“Why,” he cried out, “tha’ said that as nice an’ human as if tha’ was a\r\nreal child instead of a sharp old woman. Tha’ said it almost like\r\nDickon talks to his wild things on th’ moor.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know Dickon?” Mary asked, turning round rather in a hurry.\r\n\r\n“Everybody knows him. Dickon’s wanderin’ about everywhere. Th’ very\r\nblackberries an’ heather-bells knows him. I warrant th’ foxes shows him\r\nwhere their cubs lies an’ th’ skylarks doesn’t hide their nests from\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nMary would have liked to ask some more questions. She was almost as\r\ncurious about Dickon as she was about the deserted garden. But just\r\nthat moment the robin, who had ended his song, gave a little shake of\r\nhis wings, spread them and flew away. He had made his visit and had\r\nother things to do.\r\n\r\n“He has flown over the wall!” Mary cried out, watching him. “He has\r\nflown into the orchard—he has flown across the other wall—into the\r\ngarden where there is no door!”\r\n\r\n“He lives there,” said old Ben. “He came out o’ th’ egg there. If he’s\r\ncourtin’, he’s makin’ up to some young madam of a robin that lives\r\namong th’ old rose-trees there.”\r\n\r\n“Rose-trees,” said Mary. “Are there rose-trees?”\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff took up his spade again and began to dig.\r\n\r\n“There was ten year’ ago,” he mumbled.\r\n\r\n“I should like to see them,” said Mary. “Where is the green door? There\r\nmust be a door somewhere.”\r\n\r\nBen drove his spade deep and looked as uncompanionable as he had looked\r\nwhen she first saw him.\r\n\r\n“There was ten year’ ago, but there isn’t now,” he said.\r\n\r\n“No door!” cried Mary. “There must be.”\r\n\r\n“None as anyone can find, an’ none as is anyone’s business. Don’t you\r\nbe a meddlesome wench an’ poke your nose where it’s no cause to go.\r\nHere, I must go on with my work. Get you gone an’ play you. I’ve no\r\nmore time.”\r\n\r\nAnd he actually stopped digging, threw his spade over his shoulder and\r\nwalked off, without even glancing at her or saying good-by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\nTHE CRY IN THE CORRIDOR\r\n\r\n\r\nAt first each day which passed by for Mary Lennox was exactly like the\r\nothers. Every morning she awoke in her tapestried room and found Martha\r\nkneeling upon the hearth building her fire; every morning she ate her\r\nbreakfast in the nursery which had nothing amusing in it; and after\r\neach breakfast she gazed out of the window across to the huge moor\r\nwhich seemed to spread out on all sides and climb up to the sky, and\r\nafter she had stared for a while she realized that if she did not go\r\nout she would have to stay in and do nothing—and so she went out. She\r\ndid not know that this was the best thing she could have done, and she\r\ndid not know that, when she began to walk quickly or even run along the\r\npaths and down the avenue, she was stirring her slow blood and making\r\nherself stronger by fighting with the wind which swept down from the\r\nmoor. She ran only to make herself warm, and she hated the wind which\r\nrushed at her face and roared and held her back as if it were some\r\ngiant she could not see. But the big breaths of rough fresh air blown\r\nover the heather filled her lungs with something which was good for her\r\nwhole thin body and whipped some red color into her cheeks and\r\nbrightened her dull eyes when she did not know anything about it.\r\n\r\nBut after a few days spent almost entirely out of doors she wakened one\r\nmorning knowing what it was to be hungry, and when she sat down to her\r\nbreakfast she did not glance disdainfully at her porridge and push it\r\naway, but took up her spoon and began to eat it and went on eating it\r\nuntil her bowl was empty.\r\n\r\n“Tha’ got on well enough with that this mornin’, didn’t tha’?” said\r\nMartha.\r\n\r\n“It tastes nice today,” said Mary, feeling a little surprised herself.\r\n\r\n“It’s th’ air of th’ moor that’s givin’ thee stomach for tha’\r\nvictuals,” answered Martha. “It’s lucky for thee that tha’s got\r\nvictuals as well as appetite. There’s been twelve in our cottage as had\r\nth’ stomach an’ nothin’ to put in it. You go on playin’ you out o’\r\ndoors every day an’ you’ll get some flesh on your bones an’ you won’t\r\nbe so yeller.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t play,” said Mary. “I have nothing to play with.”\r\n\r\n“Nothin’ to play with!” exclaimed Martha. “Our children plays with\r\nsticks and stones. They just runs about an’ shouts an’ looks at\r\nthings.” Mary did not shout, but she looked at things. There was\r\nnothing else to do. She walked round and round the gardens and wandered\r\nabout the paths in the park. Sometimes she looked for Ben Weatherstaff,\r\nbut though several times she saw him at work he was too busy to look at\r\nher or was too surly. Once when she was walking toward him he picked up\r\nhis spade and turned away as if he did it on purpose.\r\n\r\nOne place she went to oftener than to any other. It was the long walk\r\noutside the gardens with the walls round them. There were bare\r\nflower-beds on either side of it and against the walls ivy grew\r\nthickly. There was one part of the wall where the creeping dark green\r\nleaves were more bushy than elsewhere. It seemed as if for a long time\r\nthat part had been neglected. The rest of it had been clipped and made\r\nto look neat, but at this lower end of the walk it had not been trimmed\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nA few days after she had talked to Ben Weatherstaff, Mary stopped to\r\nnotice this and wondered why it was so. She had just paused and was\r\nlooking up at a long spray of ivy swinging in the wind when she saw a\r\ngleam of scarlet and heard a brilliant chirp, and there, on the top of\r\nthe wall, perched Ben Weatherstaff’s robin redbreast, tilting forward\r\nto look at her with his small head on one side.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she cried out, “is it you—is it you?” And it did not seem at all\r\nqueer to her that she spoke to him as if she were sure that he would\r\nunderstand and answer her.\r\n\r\nHe did answer. He twittered and chirped and hopped along the wall as if\r\nhe were telling her all sorts of things. It seemed to Mistress Mary as\r\nif she understood him, too, though he was not speaking in words. It was\r\nas if he said:\r\n\r\n“Good morning! Isn’t the wind nice? Isn’t the sun nice? Isn’t\r\neverything nice? Let us both chirp and hop and twitter. Come on! Come\r\non!”\r\n\r\nMary began to laugh, and as he hopped and took little flights along the\r\nwall she ran after him. Poor little thin, sallow, ugly Mary—she\r\nactually looked almost pretty for a moment.\r\n\r\n“I like you! I like you!” she cried out, pattering down the walk; and\r\nshe chirped and tried to whistle, which last she did not know how to do\r\nin the least. But the robin seemed to be quite satisfied and chirped\r\nand whistled back at her. At last he spread his wings and made a\r\ndarting flight to the top of a tree, where he perched and sang loudly.\r\n\r\nThat reminded Mary of the first time she had seen him. He had been\r\nswinging on a tree-top then and she had been standing in the orchard.\r\nNow she was on the other side of the orchard and standing in the path\r\noutside a wall—much lower down—and there was the same tree inside.\r\n\r\n“It’s in the garden no one can go into,” she said to herself. “It’s the\r\ngarden without a door. He lives in there. How I wish I could see what\r\nit is like!”\r\n\r\nShe ran up the walk to the green door she had entered the first\r\nmorning. Then she ran down the path through the other door and then\r\ninto the orchard, and when she stood and looked up there was the tree\r\non the other side of the wall, and there was the robin just finishing\r\nhis song and beginning to preen his feathers with his beak.\r\n\r\n“It is the garden,” she said. “I am sure it is.”\r\n\r\nShe walked round and looked closely at that side of the orchard wall,\r\nbut she only found what she had found before—that there was no door in\r\nit. Then she ran through the kitchen-gardens again and out into the\r\nwalk outside the long ivy-covered wall, and she walked to the end of it\r\nand looked at it, but there was no door; and then she walked to the\r\nother end, looking again, but there was no door.\r\n\r\n“It’s very queer,” she said. “Ben Weatherstaff said there was no door\r\nand there is no door. But there must have been one ten years ago,\r\nbecause Mr. Craven buried the key.”\r\n\r\nThis gave her so much to think of that she began to be quite interested\r\nand feel that she was not sorry that she had come to Misselthwaite\r\nManor. In India she had always felt hot and too languid to care much\r\nabout anything. The fact was that the fresh wind from the moor had\r\nbegun to blow the cobwebs out of her young brain and to waken her up a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nShe stayed out of doors nearly all day, and when she sat down to her\r\nsupper at night she felt hungry and drowsy and comfortable. She did not\r\nfeel cross when Martha chattered away. She felt as if she rather liked\r\nto hear her, and at last she thought she would ask her a question. She\r\nasked it after she had finished her supper and had sat down on the\r\nhearth-rug before the fire.\r\n\r\n“Why did Mr. Craven hate the garden?” she said.\r\n\r\nShe had made Martha stay with her and Martha had not objected at all.\r\nShe was very young, and used to a crowded cottage full of brothers and\r\nsisters, and she found it dull in the great servants’ hall downstairs\r\nwhere the footman and upper-housemaids made fun of her Yorkshire speech\r\nand looked upon her as a common little thing, and sat and whispered\r\namong themselves. Martha liked to talk, and the strange child who had\r\nlived in India, and been waited upon by “blacks,” was novelty enough to\r\nattract her.\r\n\r\nShe sat down on the hearth herself without waiting to be asked.\r\n\r\n“Art tha’ thinkin’ about that garden yet?” she said. “I knew tha’\r\nwould. That was just the way with me when I first heard about it.”\r\n\r\n“Why did he hate it?” Mary persisted.\r\n\r\nMartha tucked her feet under her and made herself quite comfortable.\r\n\r\n“Listen to th’ wind wutherin’ round the house,” she said. “You could\r\nbare stand up on the moor if you was out on it tonight.”\r\n\r\nMary did not know what “wutherin’” meant until she listened, and then\r\nshe understood. It must mean that hollow shuddering sort of roar which\r\nrushed round and round the house as if the giant no one could see were\r\nbuffeting it and beating at the walls and windows to try to break in.\r\nBut one knew he could not get in, and somehow it made one feel very\r\nsafe and warm inside a room with a red coal fire.\r\n\r\n“But why did he hate it so?” she asked, after she had listened. She\r\nintended to know if Martha did.\r\n\r\nThen Martha gave up her store of knowledge.\r\n\r\n“Mind,” she said, “Mrs. Medlock said it’s not to be talked about.\r\nThere’s lots o’ things in this place that’s not to be talked over.\r\nThat’s Mr. Craven’s orders. His troubles are none servants’ business,\r\nhe says. But for th’ garden he wouldn’t be like he is. It was Mrs.\r\nCraven’s garden that she had made when first they were married an’ she\r\njust loved it, an’ they used to ’tend the flowers themselves. An’ none\r\no’ th’ gardeners was ever let to go in. Him an’ her used to go in an’\r\nshut th’ door an’ stay there hours an’ hours, readin’ and talkin’. An’\r\nshe was just a bit of a girl an’ there was an old tree with a branch\r\nbent like a seat on it. An’ she made roses grow over it an’ she used to\r\nsit there. But one day when she was sittin’ there th’ branch broke an’\r\nshe fell on th’ ground an’ was hurt so bad that next day she died. Th’\r\ndoctors thought he’d go out o’ his mind an’ die, too. That’s why he\r\nhates it. No one’s never gone in since, an’ he won’t let anyone talk\r\nabout it.”\r\n\r\nMary did not ask any more questions. She looked at the red fire and\r\nlistened to the wind “wutherin’.” It seemed to be “wutherin’” louder\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\nAt that moment a very good thing was happening to her. Four good things\r\nhad happened to her, in fact, since she came to Misselthwaite Manor.\r\nShe had felt as if she had understood a robin and that he had\r\nunderstood her; she had run in the wind until her blood had grown warm;\r\nshe had been healthily hungry for the first time in her life; and she\r\nhad found out what it was to be sorry for someone.\r\n\r\nBut as she was listening to the wind she began to listen to something\r\nelse. She did not know what it was, because at first she could scarcely\r\ndistinguish it from the wind itself. It was a curious sound—it seemed\r\nalmost as if a child were crying somewhere. Sometimes the wind sounded\r\nrather like a child crying, but presently Mistress Mary felt quite sure\r\nthis sound was inside the house, not outside it. It was far away, but\r\nit was inside. She turned round and looked at Martha.\r\n\r\n“Do you hear anyone crying?” she said.\r\n\r\nMartha suddenly looked confused.\r\n\r\n“No,” she answered. “It’s th’ wind. Sometimes it sounds like as if\r\nsomeone was lost on th’ moor an’ wailin’. It’s got all sorts o’\r\nsounds.”\r\n\r\n“But listen,” said Mary. “It’s in the house—down one of those long\r\ncorridors.”\r\n\r\nAnd at that very moment a door must have been opened somewhere\r\ndownstairs; for a great rushing draft blew along the passage and the\r\ndoor of the room they sat in was blown open with a crash, and as they\r\nboth jumped to their feet the light was blown out and the crying sound\r\nwas swept down the far corridor so that it was to be heard more plainly\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\n“There!” said Mary. “I told you so! It is someone crying—and it isn’t a\r\ngrown-up person.”\r\n\r\nMartha ran and shut the door and turned the key, but before she did it\r\nthey both heard the sound of a door in some far passage shutting with a\r\nbang, and then everything was quiet, for even the wind ceased\r\n“wutherin’” for a few moments.\r\n\r\n“It was th’ wind,” said Martha stubbornly. “An’ if it wasn’t, it was\r\nlittle Betty Butterworth, th’ scullery-maid. She’s had th’ toothache\r\nall day.”\r\n\r\nBut something troubled and awkward in her manner made Mistress Mary\r\nstare very hard at her. She did not believe she was speaking the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n“THERE WAS SOMEONE CRYING—THERE WAS!”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day the rain poured down in torrents again, and when Mary\r\nlooked out of her window the moor was almost hidden by gray mist and\r\ncloud. There could be no going out today.\r\n\r\n“What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?” she asked\r\nMartha.\r\n\r\n“Try to keep from under each other’s feet mostly,” Martha answered.\r\n“Eh! there does seem a lot of us then. Mother’s a good-tempered woman\r\nbut she gets fair moithered. The biggest ones goes out in th’ cow-shed\r\nand plays there. Dickon he doesn’t mind th’ wet. He goes out just th’\r\nsame as if th’ sun was shinin’. He says he sees things on rainy days as\r\ndoesn’t show when it’s fair weather. He once found a little fox cub\r\nhalf drowned in its hole and he brought it home in th’ bosom of his\r\nshirt to keep it warm. Its mother had been killed nearby an’ th’ hole\r\nwas swum out an’ th’ rest o’ th’ litter was dead. He’s got it at home\r\nnow. He found a half-drowned young crow another time an’ he brought it\r\nhome, too, an’ tamed it. It’s named Soot because it’s so black, an’ it\r\nhops an’ flies about with him everywhere.”\r\n\r\nThe time had come when Mary had forgotten to resent Martha’s familiar\r\ntalk. She had even begun to find it interesting and to be sorry when\r\nshe stopped or went away. The stories she had been told by her Ayah\r\nwhen she lived in India had been quite unlike those Martha had to tell\r\nabout the moorland cottage which held fourteen people who lived in four\r\nlittle rooms and never had quite enough to eat. The children seemed to\r\ntumble about and amuse themselves like a litter of rough, good-natured\r\ncollie puppies. Mary was most attracted by the mother and Dickon. When\r\nMartha told stories of what “mother” said or did they always sounded\r\ncomfortable.\r\n\r\n“If I had a raven or a fox cub I could play with it,” said Mary. “But I\r\nhave nothing.”\r\n\r\nMartha looked perplexed.\r\n\r\n“Can tha’ knit?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“No,” answered Mary.\r\n\r\n“Can tha’ sew?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Can tha’ read?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Then why doesn’t tha read somethin’, or learn a bit o’ spellin’?\r\nTha’st old enough to be learnin’ thy book a good bit now.”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t any books,” said Mary. “Those I had were left in India.”\r\n\r\n“That’s a pity,” said Martha. “If Mrs. Medlock’d let thee go into th’\r\nlibrary, there’s thousands o’ books there.”\r\n\r\nMary did not ask where the library was, because she was suddenly\r\ninspired by a new idea. She made up her mind to go and find it herself.\r\nShe was not troubled about Mrs. Medlock. Mrs. Medlock seemed always to\r\nbe in her comfortable housekeeper’s sitting-room downstairs. In this\r\nqueer place one scarcely ever saw anyone at all. In fact, there was no\r\none to see but the servants, and when their master was away they lived\r\na luxurious life below stairs, where there was a huge kitchen hung\r\nabout with shining brass and pewter, and a large servants’ hall where\r\nthere were four or five abundant meals eaten every day, and where a\r\ngreat deal of lively romping went on when Mrs. Medlock was out of the\r\nway.\r\n\r\nMary’s meals were served regularly, and Martha waited on her, but no\r\none troubled themselves about her in the least. Mrs. Medlock came and\r\nlooked at her every day or two, but no one inquired what she did or\r\ntold her what to do. She supposed that perhaps this was the English way\r\nof treating children. In India she had always been attended by her\r\nAyah, who had followed her about and waited on her, hand and foot. She\r\nhad often been tired of her company. Now she was followed by nobody and\r\nwas learning to dress herself because Martha looked as though she\r\nthought she was silly and stupid when she wanted to have things handed\r\nto her and put on.\r\n\r\n“Hasn’t tha’ got good sense?” she said once, when Mary had stood\r\nwaiting for her to put on her gloves for her. “Our Susan Ann is twice\r\nas sharp as thee an’ she’s only four year’ old. Sometimes tha’ looks\r\nfair soft in th’ head.”\r\n\r\nMary had worn her contrary scowl for an hour after that, but it made\r\nher think several entirely new things.\r\n\r\nShe stood at the window for about ten minutes this morning after Martha\r\nhad swept up the hearth for the last time and gone downstairs. She was\r\nthinking over the new idea which had come to her when she heard of the\r\nlibrary. She did not care very much about the library itself, because\r\nshe had read very few books; but to hear of it brought back to her mind\r\nthe hundred rooms with closed doors. She wondered if they were all\r\nreally locked and what she would find if she could get into any of\r\nthem. Were there a hundred really? Why shouldn’t she go and see how\r\nmany doors she could count? It would be something to do on this morning\r\nwhen she could not go out. She had never been taught to ask permission\r\nto do things, and she knew nothing at all about authority, so she would\r\nnot have thought it necessary to ask Mrs. Medlock if she might walk\r\nabout the house, even if she had seen her.\r\n\r\nShe opened the door of the room and went into the corridor, and then\r\nshe began her wanderings. It was a long corridor and it branched into\r\nother corridors and it led her up short flights of steps which mounted\r\nto others again. There were doors and doors, and there were pictures on\r\nthe walls. Sometimes they were pictures of dark, curious landscapes,\r\nbut oftenest they were portraits of men and women in queer, grand\r\ncostumes made of satin and velvet. She found herself in one long\r\ngallery whose walls were covered with these portraits. She had never\r\nthought there could be so many in any house. She walked slowly down\r\nthis place and stared at the faces which also seemed to stare at her.\r\nShe felt as if they were wondering what a little girl from India was\r\ndoing in their house. Some were pictures of children—little girls in\r\nthick satin frocks which reached to their feet and stood out about\r\nthem, and boys with puffed sleeves and lace collars and long hair, or\r\nwith big ruffs around their necks. She always stopped to look at the\r\nchildren, and wonder what their names were, and where they had gone,\r\nand why they wore such odd clothes. There was a stiff, plain little\r\ngirl rather like herself. She wore a green brocade dress and held a\r\ngreen parrot on her finger. Her eyes had a sharp, curious look.\r\n\r\n“Where do you live now?” said Mary aloud to her. “I wish you were\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nSurely no other little girl ever spent such a queer morning. It seemed\r\nas if there was no one in all the huge rambling house but her own small\r\nself, wandering about upstairs and down, through narrow passages and\r\nwide ones, where it seemed to her that no one but herself had ever\r\nwalked. Since so many rooms had been built, people must have lived in\r\nthem, but it all seemed so empty that she could not quite believe it\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nIt was not until she climbed to the second floor that she thought of\r\nturning the handle of a door. All the doors were shut, as Mrs. Medlock\r\nhad said they were, but at last she put her hand on the handle of one\r\nof them and turned it. She was almost frightened for a moment when she\r\nfelt that it turned without difficulty and that when she pushed upon\r\nthe door itself it slowly and heavily opened. It was a massive door and\r\nopened into a big bedroom. There were embroidered hangings on the wall,\r\nand inlaid furniture such as she had seen in India stood about the\r\nroom. A broad window with leaded panes looked out upon the moor; and\r\nover the mantel was another portrait of the stiff, plain little girl\r\nwho seemed to stare at her more curiously than ever.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps she slept here once,” said Mary. “She stares at me so that she\r\nmakes me feel queer.”\r\n\r\nAfter that she opened more doors and more. She saw so many rooms that\r\nshe became quite tired and began to think that there must be a hundred,\r\nthough she had not counted them. In all of them there were old pictures\r\nor old tapestries with strange scenes worked on them. There were\r\ncurious pieces of furniture and curious ornaments in nearly all of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn one room, which looked like a lady’s sitting-room, the hangings were\r\nall embroidered velvet, and in a cabinet were about a hundred little\r\nelephants made of ivory. They were of different sizes, and some had\r\ntheir mahouts or palanquins on their backs. Some were much bigger than\r\nthe others and some were so tiny that they seemed only babies. Mary had\r\nseen carved ivory in India and she knew all about elephants. She opened\r\nthe door of the cabinet and stood on a footstool and played with these\r\nfor quite a long time. When she got tired she set the elephants in\r\norder and shut the door of the cabinet.\r\n\r\nIn all her wanderings through the long corridors and the empty rooms,\r\nshe had seen nothing alive; but in this room she saw something. Just\r\nafter she had closed the cabinet door she heard a tiny rustling sound.\r\nIt made her jump and look around at the sofa by the fireplace, from\r\nwhich it seemed to come. In the corner of the sofa there was a cushion,\r\nand in the velvet which covered it there was a hole, and out of the\r\nhole peeped a tiny head with a pair of frightened eyes in it.\r\n\r\nMary crept softly across the room to look. The bright eyes belonged to\r\na little gray mouse, and the mouse had eaten a hole into the cushion\r\nand made a comfortable nest there. Six baby mice were cuddled up asleep\r\nnear her. If there was no one else alive in the hundred rooms there\r\nwere seven mice who did not look lonely at all.\r\n\r\n“If they wouldn’t be so frightened I would take them back with me,”\r\nsaid Mary.\r\n\r\nShe had wandered about long enough to feel too tired to wander any\r\nfarther, and she turned back. Two or three times she lost her way by\r\nturning down the wrong corridor and was obliged to ramble up and down\r\nuntil she found the right one; but at last she reached her own floor\r\nagain, though she was some distance from her own room and did not know\r\nexactly where she was.\r\n\r\n“I believe I have taken a wrong turning again,” she said, standing\r\nstill at what seemed the end of a short passage with tapestry on the\r\nwall. “I don’t know which way to go. How still everything is!”\r\n\r\nIt was while she was standing here and just after she had said this\r\nthat the stillness was broken by a sound. It was another cry, but not\r\nquite like the one she had heard last night; it was only a short one, a\r\nfretful childish whine muffled by passing through walls.\r\n\r\n“It’s nearer than it was,” said Mary, her heart beating rather faster.\r\n“And it _is_ crying.”\r\n\r\nShe put her hand accidentally upon the tapestry near her, and then\r\nsprang back, feeling quite startled. The tapestry was the covering of a\r\ndoor which fell open and showed her that there was another part of the\r\ncorridor behind it, and Mrs. Medlock was coming up it with her bunch of\r\nkeys in her hand and a very cross look on her face.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing here?” she said, and she took Mary by the arm and\r\npulled her away. “What did I tell you?”\r\n\r\n“I turned round the wrong corner,” explained Mary. “I didn’t know which\r\nway to go and I heard someone crying.” She quite hated Mrs. Medlock at\r\nthe moment, but she hated her more the next.\r\n\r\n“You didn’t hear anything of the sort,” said the housekeeper. “You come\r\nalong back to your own nursery or I’ll box your ears.”\r\n\r\nAnd she took her by the arm and half pushed, half pulled her up one\r\npassage and down another until she pushed her in at the door of her own\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n“Now,” she said, “you stay where you’re told to stay or you’ll find\r\nyourself locked up. The master had better get you a governess, same as\r\nhe said he would. You’re one that needs someone to look sharp after\r\nyou. I’ve got enough to do.”\r\n\r\nShe went out of the room and slammed the door after her, and Mary went\r\nand sat on the hearth-rug, pale with rage. She did not cry, but ground\r\nher teeth.\r\n\r\n“There _was_ someone crying—there _was_—there _was!_” she said to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nShe had heard it twice now, and sometime she would find out. She had\r\nfound out a great deal this morning. She felt as if she had been on a\r\nlong journey, and at any rate she had had something to amuse her all\r\nthe time, and she had played with the ivory elephants and had seen the\r\ngray mouse and its babies in their nest in the velvet cushion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\nTHE KEY TO THE GARDEN\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days after this, when Mary opened her eyes she sat upright in bed\r\nimmediately, and called to Martha.\r\n\r\n“Look at the moor! Look at the moor!”\r\n\r\nThe rainstorm had ended and the gray mist and clouds had been swept\r\naway in the night by the wind. The wind itself had ceased and a\r\nbrilliant, deep blue sky arched high over the moorland. Never, never\r\nhad Mary dreamed of a sky so blue. In India skies were hot and blazing;\r\nthis was of a deep cool blue which almost seemed to sparkle like the\r\nwaters of some lovely bottomless lake, and here and there, high, high\r\nin the arched blueness floated small clouds of snow-white fleece. The\r\nfar-reaching world of the moor itself looked softly blue instead of\r\ngloomy purple-black or awful dreary gray.\r\n\r\n“Aye,” said Martha with a cheerful grin. “Th’ storm’s over for a bit.\r\nIt does like this at this time o’ th’ year. It goes off in a night like\r\nit was pretendin’ it had never been here an’ never meant to come again.\r\nThat’s because th’ springtime’s on its way. It’s a long way off yet,\r\nbut it’s comin’.”\r\n\r\n“I thought perhaps it always rained or looked dark in England,” Mary\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“Eh! no!” said Martha, sitting up on her heels among her black lead\r\nbrushes. “Nowt o’ th’ soart!”\r\n\r\n“What does that mean?” asked Mary seriously. In India the natives spoke\r\ndifferent dialects which only a few people understood, so she was not\r\nsurprised when Martha used words she did not know.\r\n\r\nMartha laughed as she had done the first morning.\r\n\r\n“There now,” she said. “I’ve talked broad Yorkshire again like Mrs.\r\nMedlock said I mustn’t. ‘Nowt o’ th’ soart’ means\r\n‘nothin’-of-the-sort,’” slowly and carefully, “but it takes so long to\r\nsay it. Yorkshire’s th’ sunniest place on earth when it is sunny. I\r\ntold thee tha’d like th’ moor after a bit. Just you wait till you see\r\nth’ gold-colored gorse blossoms an’ th’ blossoms o’ th’ broom, an’ th’\r\nheather flowerin’, all purple bells, an’ hundreds o’ butterflies\r\nflutterin’ an’ bees hummin’ an’ skylarks soarin’ up an’ singin’. You’ll\r\nwant to get out on it at sunrise an’ live out on it all day like Dickon\r\ndoes.”\r\n\r\n“Could I ever get there?” asked Mary wistfully, looking through her\r\nwindow at the far-off blue. It was so new and big and wonderful and\r\nsuch a heavenly color.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know,” answered Martha. “Tha’s never used tha’ legs since tha’\r\nwas born, it seems to me. Tha’ couldn’t walk five mile. It’s five mile\r\nto our cottage.”\r\n\r\n“I should like to see your cottage.”\r\n\r\nMartha stared at her a moment curiously before she took up her\r\npolishing brush and began to rub the grate again. She was thinking that\r\nthe small plain face did not look quite as sour at this moment as it\r\nhad done the first morning she saw it. It looked just a trifle like\r\nlittle Susan Ann’s when she wanted something very much.\r\n\r\n“I’ll ask my mother about it,” she said. “She’s one o’ them that nearly\r\nalways sees a way to do things. It’s my day out today an’ I’m goin’\r\nhome. Eh! I am glad. Mrs. Medlock thinks a lot o’ mother. Perhaps she\r\ncould talk to her.”\r\n\r\n“I like your mother,” said Mary.\r\n\r\n“I should think tha’ did,” agreed Martha, polishing away.\r\n\r\n“I’ve never seen her,” said Mary.\r\n\r\n“No, tha’ hasn’t,” replied Martha.\r\n\r\nShe sat up on her heels again and rubbed the end of her nose with the\r\nback of her hand as if puzzled for a moment, but she ended quite\r\npositively.\r\n\r\n“Well, she’s that sensible an’ hard workin’ an’ good-natured an’ clean\r\nthat no one could help likin’ her whether they’d seen her or not. When\r\nI’m goin’ home to her on my day out I just jump for joy when I’m\r\ncrossin’ the moor.”\r\n\r\n“I like Dickon,” added Mary. “And I’ve never seen him.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Martha stoutly, “I’ve told thee that th’ very birds likes\r\nhim an’ th’ rabbits an’ wild sheep an’ ponies, an’ th’ foxes\r\nthemselves. I wonder,” staring at her reflectively, “what Dickon would\r\nthink of thee?”\r\n\r\n“He wouldn’t like me,” said Mary in her stiff, cold little way. “No one\r\ndoes.”\r\n\r\nMartha looked reflective again.\r\n\r\n“How does tha’ like thysel’?” she inquired, really quite as if she were\r\ncurious to know.\r\n\r\nMary hesitated a moment and thought it over.\r\n\r\n“Not at all—really,” she answered. “But I never thought of that\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\nMartha grinned a little as if at some homely recollection.\r\n\r\n“Mother said that to me once,” she said. “She was at her wash-tub an’ I\r\nwas in a bad temper an’ talkin’ ill of folk, an’ she turns round on me\r\nan’ says: ‘Tha’ young vixen, tha’! There tha’ stands sayin’ tha’\r\ndoesn’t like this one an’ tha’ doesn’t like that one. How does tha’\r\nlike thysel’?’ It made me laugh an’ it brought me to my senses in a\r\nminute.”\r\n\r\nShe went away in high spirits as soon as she had given Mary her\r\nbreakfast. She was going to walk five miles across the moor to the\r\ncottage, and she was going to help her mother with the washing and do\r\nthe week’s baking and enjoy herself thoroughly.\r\n\r\nMary felt lonelier than ever when she knew she was no longer in the\r\nhouse. She went out into the garden as quickly as possible, and the\r\nfirst thing she did was to run round and round the fountain flower\r\ngarden ten times. She counted the times carefully and when she had\r\nfinished she felt in better spirits. The sunshine made the whole place\r\nlook different. The high, deep, blue sky arched over Misselthwaite as\r\nwell as over the moor, and she kept lifting her face and looking up\r\ninto it, trying to imagine what it would be like to lie down on one of\r\nthe little snow-white clouds and float about. She went into the first\r\nkitchen-garden and found Ben Weatherstaff working there with two other\r\ngardeners. The change in the weather seemed to have done him good. He\r\nspoke to her of his own accord.\r\n\r\n“Springtime’s comin,’” he said. “Cannot tha’ smell it?”\r\n\r\nMary sniffed and thought she could.\r\n\r\n“I smell something nice and fresh and damp,” she said.\r\n\r\n“That’s th’ good rich earth,” he answered, digging away. “It’s in a\r\ngood humor makin’ ready to grow things. It’s glad when plantin’ time\r\ncomes. It’s dull in th’ winter when it’s got nowt to do. In th’ flower\r\ngardens out there things will be stirrin’ down below in th’ dark. Th’\r\nsun’s warmin’ ’em. You’ll see bits o’ green spikes stickin’ out o’ th’\r\nblack earth after a bit.”\r\n\r\n“What will they be?” asked Mary.\r\n\r\n“Crocuses an’ snowdrops an’ daffydowndillys. Has tha’ never seen them?”\r\n\r\n“No. Everything is hot, and wet, and green after the rains in India,”\r\nsaid Mary. “And I think things grow up in a night.”\r\n\r\n“These won’t grow up in a night,” said Weatherstaff. “Tha’ll have to\r\nwait for ’em. They’ll poke up a bit higher here, an’ push out a spike\r\nmore there, an’ uncurl a leaf this day an’ another that. You watch\r\n’em.”\r\n\r\n“I am going to,” answered Mary.\r\n\r\nVery soon she heard the soft rustling flight of wings again and she\r\nknew at once that the robin had come again. He was very pert and\r\nlively, and hopped about so close to her feet, and put his head on one\r\nside and looked at her so slyly that she asked Ben Weatherstaff a\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“Do you think he remembers me?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Remembers thee!” said Weatherstaff indignantly. “He knows every\r\ncabbage stump in th’ gardens, let alone th’ people. He’s never seen a\r\nlittle wench here before, an’ he’s bent on findin’ out all about thee.\r\nTha’s no need to try to hide anything from _him_.”\r\n\r\n“Are things stirring down below in the dark in that garden where he\r\nlives?” Mary inquired.\r\n\r\n“What garden?” grunted Weatherstaff, becoming surly again.\r\n\r\n“The one where the old rose-trees are.” She could not help asking,\r\nbecause she wanted so much to know. “Are all the flowers dead, or do\r\nsome of them come again in the summer? Are there ever any roses?”\r\n\r\n“Ask him,” said Ben Weatherstaff, hunching his shoulders toward the\r\nrobin. “He’s the only one as knows. No one else has seen inside it for\r\nten year’.”\r\n\r\nTen years was a long time, Mary thought. She had been born ten years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nShe walked away, slowly thinking. She had begun to like the garden just\r\nas she had begun to like the robin and Dickon and Martha’s mother. She\r\nwas beginning to like Martha, too. That seemed a good many people to\r\nlike—when you were not used to liking. She thought of the robin as one\r\nof the people. She went to her walk outside the long, ivy-covered wall\r\nover which she could see the tree-tops; and the second time she walked\r\nup and down the most interesting and exciting thing happened to her,\r\nand it was all through Ben Weatherstaff’s robin.\r\n\r\nShe heard a chirp and a twitter, and when she looked at the bare\r\nflower-bed at her left side there he was hopping about and pretending\r\nto peck things out of the earth to persuade her that he had not\r\nfollowed her. But she knew he had followed her and the surprise so\r\nfilled her with delight that she almost trembled a little.\r\n\r\n“You do remember me!” she cried out. “You do! You are prettier than\r\nanything else in the world!”\r\n\r\nShe chirped, and talked, and coaxed and he hopped, and flirted his tail\r\nand twittered. It was as if he were talking. His red waistcoat was like\r\nsatin and he puffed his tiny breast out and was so fine and so grand\r\nand so pretty that it was really as if he were showing her how\r\nimportant and like a human person a robin could be. Mistress Mary\r\nforgot that she had ever been contrary in her life when he allowed her\r\nto draw closer and closer to him, and bend down and talk and try to\r\nmake something like robin sounds.\r\n\r\nOh! to think that he should actually let her come as near to him as\r\nthat! He knew nothing in the world would make her put out her hand\r\ntoward him or startle him in the least tiniest way. He knew it because\r\nhe was a real person—only nicer than any other person in the world. She\r\nwas so happy that she scarcely dared to breathe.\r\n\r\nThe flower-bed was not quite bare. It was bare of flowers because the\r\nperennial plants had been cut down for their winter rest, but there\r\nwere tall shrubs and low ones which grew together at the back of the\r\nbed, and as the robin hopped about under them she saw him hop over a\r\nsmall pile of freshly turned up earth. He stopped on it to look for a\r\nworm. The earth had been turned up because a dog had been trying to dig\r\nup a mole and he had scratched quite a deep hole.\r\n\r\nMary looked at it, not really knowing why the hole was there, and as\r\nshe looked she saw something almost buried in the newly-turned soil. It\r\nwas something like a ring of rusty iron or brass and when the robin\r\nflew up into a tree nearby she put out her hand and picked the ring up.\r\nIt was more than a ring, however; it was an old key which looked as if\r\nit had been buried a long time.\r\n\r\nMistress Mary stood up and looked at it with an almost frightened face\r\nas it hung from her finger.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it has been buried for ten years,” she said in a whisper.\r\n“Perhaps it is the key to the garden!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\nTHE ROBIN WHO SHOWED THE WAY\r\n\r\n\r\nShe looked at the key quite a long time. She turned it over and over,\r\nand thought about it. As I have said before, she was not a child who\r\nhad been trained to ask permission or consult her elders about things.\r\nAll she thought about the key was that if it was the key to the closed\r\ngarden, and she could find out where the door was, she could perhaps\r\nopen it and see what was inside the walls, and what had happened to the\r\nold rose-trees. It was because it had been shut up so long that she\r\nwanted to see it. It seemed as if it must be different from other\r\nplaces and that something strange must have happened to it during ten\r\nyears. Besides that, if she liked it she could go into it every day and\r\nshut the door behind her, and she could make up some play of her own\r\nand play it quite alone, because nobody would ever know where she was,\r\nbut would think the door was still locked and the key buried in the\r\nearth. The thought of that pleased her very much.\r\n\r\nLiving as it were, all by herself in a house with a hundred\r\nmysteriously closed rooms and having nothing whatever to do to amuse\r\nherself, had set her inactive brain to working and was actually\r\nawakening her imagination. There is no doubt that the fresh, strong,\r\npure air from the moor had a great deal to do with it. Just as it had\r\ngiven her an appetite, and fighting with the wind had stirred her\r\nblood, so the same things had stirred her mind. In India she had always\r\nbeen too hot and languid and weak to care much about anything, but in\r\nthis place she was beginning to care and to want to do new things.\r\nAlready she felt less “contrary,” though she did not know why.\r\n\r\nShe put the key in her pocket and walked up and down her walk. No one\r\nbut herself ever seemed to come there, so she could walk slowly and\r\nlook at the wall, or, rather, at the ivy growing on it. The ivy was the\r\nbaffling thing. Howsoever carefully she looked she could see nothing\r\nbut thickly growing, glossy, dark green leaves. She was very much\r\ndisappointed. Something of her contrariness came back to her as she\r\npaced the walk and looked over it at the tree-tops inside. It seemed so\r\nsilly, she said to herself, to be near it and not be able to get in.\r\nShe took the key in her pocket when she went back to the house, and she\r\nmade up her mind that she would always carry it with her when she went\r\nout, so that if she ever should find the hidden door she would be\r\nready.\r\n\r\nMrs. Medlock had allowed Martha to sleep all night at the cottage, but\r\nshe was back at her work in the morning with cheeks redder than ever\r\nand in the best of spirits.\r\n\r\n“I got up at four o’clock,” she said. “Eh! it was pretty on th’ moor\r\nwith th’ birds gettin’ up an’ th’ rabbits scamperin’ about an’ th’ sun\r\nrisin’. I didn’t walk all th’ way. A man gave me a ride in his cart an’\r\nI did enjoy myself.”\r\n\r\nShe was full of stories of the delights of her day out. Her mother had\r\nbeen glad to see her and they had got the baking and washing all out of\r\nthe way. She had even made each of the children a doughcake with a bit\r\nof brown sugar in it.\r\n\r\n“I had ’em all pipin’ hot when they came in from playin’ on th’ moor.\r\nAn’ th’ cottage all smelt o’ nice, clean hot bakin’ an’ there was a\r\ngood fire, an’ they just shouted for joy. Our Dickon he said our\r\ncottage was good enough for a king to live in.”\r\n\r\nIn the evening they had all sat round the fire, and Martha and her\r\nmother had sewed patches on torn clothes and mended stockings and\r\nMartha had told them about the little girl who had come from India and\r\nwho had been waited on all her life by what Martha called “blacks”\r\nuntil she didn’t know how to put on her own stockings.\r\n\r\n“Eh! they did like to hear about you,” said Martha. “They wanted to\r\nknow all about th’ blacks an’ about th’ ship you came in. I couldn’t\r\ntell ’em enough.”\r\n\r\nMary reflected a little.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you a great deal more before your next day out,” she said,\r\n“so that you will have more to talk about. I dare say they would like\r\nto hear about riding on elephants and camels, and about the officers\r\ngoing to hunt tigers.”\r\n\r\n“My word!” cried delighted Martha. “It would set ’em clean off their\r\nheads. Would tha’ really do that, Miss? It would be same as a wild\r\nbeast show like we heard they had in York once.”\r\n\r\n“India is quite different from Yorkshire,” Mary said slowly, as she\r\nthought the matter over. “I never thought of that. Did Dickon and your\r\nmother like to hear you talk about me?”\r\n\r\n“Why, our Dickon’s eyes nearly started out o’ his head, they got that\r\nround,” answered Martha. “But mother, she was put out about your\r\nseemin’ to be all by yourself like. She said, ‘Hasn’t Mr. Craven got no\r\ngoverness for her, nor no nurse?’ and I said, ‘No, he hasn’t, though\r\nMrs. Medlock says he will when he thinks of it, but she says he mayn’t\r\nthink of it for two or three years.’”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want a governess,” said Mary sharply.\r\n\r\n“But mother says you ought to be learnin’ your book by this time an’\r\nyou ought to have a woman to look after you, an’ she says: ‘Now,\r\nMartha, you just think how you’d feel yourself, in a big place like\r\nthat, wanderin’ about all alone, an’ no mother. You do your best to\r\ncheer her up,’ she says, an’ I said I would.”\r\n\r\nMary gave her a long, steady look.\r\n\r\n“You do cheer me up,” she said. “I like to hear you talk.”\r\n\r\nPresently Martha went out of the room and came back with something held\r\nin her hands under her apron.\r\n\r\n“What does tha’ think,” she said, with a cheerful grin. “I’ve brought\r\nthee a present.”\r\n\r\n“A present!” exclaimed Mistress Mary. How could a cottage full of\r\nfourteen hungry people give anyone a present!\r\n\r\n“A man was drivin’ across the moor peddlin’,” Martha explained. “An’ he\r\nstopped his cart at our door. He had pots an’ pans an’ odds an’ ends,\r\nbut mother had no money to buy anythin’. Just as he was goin’ away our\r\n’Lizabeth Ellen called out, ‘Mother, he’s got skippin’-ropes with red\r\nan’ blue handles.’ An’ mother she calls out quite sudden, ‘Here, stop,\r\nmister! How much are they?’ An’ he says ‘Tuppence’, an’ mother she\r\nbegan fumblin’ in her pocket an’ she says to me, ‘Martha, tha’s brought\r\nme thy wages like a good lass, an’ I’ve got four places to put every\r\npenny, but I’m just goin’ to take tuppence out of it to buy that child\r\na skippin’-rope,’ an’ she bought one an’ here it is.”\r\n\r\nShe brought it out from under her apron and exhibited it quite proudly.\r\nIt was a strong, slender rope with a striped red and blue handle at\r\neach end, but Mary Lennox had never seen a skipping-rope before. She\r\ngazed at it with a mystified expression.\r\n\r\n“What is it for?” she asked curiously.\r\n\r\n“For!” cried out Martha. “Does tha’ mean that they’ve not got\r\nskippin’-ropes in India, for all they’ve got elephants and tigers and\r\ncamels! No wonder most of ’em’s black. This is what it’s for; just\r\nwatch me.”\r\n\r\nAnd she ran into the middle of the room and, taking a handle in each\r\nhand, began to skip, and skip, and skip, while Mary turned in her chair\r\nto stare at her, and the queer faces in the old portraits seemed to\r\nstare at her, too, and wonder what on earth this common little cottager\r\nhad the impudence to be doing under their very noses. But Martha did\r\nnot even see them. The interest and curiosity in Mistress Mary’s face\r\ndelighted her, and she went on skipping and counted as she skipped\r\nuntil she had reached a hundred.\r\n\r\n“I could skip longer than that,” she said when she stopped. “I’ve\r\nskipped as much as five hundred when I was twelve, but I wasn’t as fat\r\nthen as I am now, an’ I was in practice.”\r\n\r\nMary got up from her chair beginning to feel excited herself.\r\n\r\n“It looks nice,” she said. “Your mother is a kind woman. Do you think I\r\ncould ever skip like that?”\r\n\r\n“You just try it,” urged Martha, handing her the skipping-rope. “You\r\ncan’t skip a hundred at first, but if you practice you’ll mount up.\r\nThat’s what mother said. She says, ‘Nothin’ will do her more good than\r\nskippin’ rope. It’s th’ sensiblest toy a child can have. Let her play\r\nout in th’ fresh air skippin’ an’ it’ll stretch her legs an’ arms an’\r\ngive her some strength in ’em.’”\r\n\r\nIt was plain that there was not a great deal of strength in Mistress\r\nMary’s arms and legs when she first began to skip. She was not very\r\nclever at it, but she liked it so much that she did not want to stop.\r\n\r\n“Put on tha’ things and run an’ skip out o’ doors,” said Martha.\r\n“Mother said I must tell you to keep out o’ doors as much as you could,\r\neven when it rains a bit, so as tha’ wrap up warm.”\r\n\r\nMary put on her coat and hat and took her skipping-rope over her arm.\r\nShe opened the door to go out, and then suddenly thought of something\r\nand turned back rather slowly.\r\n\r\n“Martha,” she said, “they were your wages. It was your two-pence\r\nreally. Thank you.” She said it stiffly because she was not used to\r\nthanking people or noticing that they did things for her. “Thank you,”\r\nshe said, and held out her hand because she did not know what else to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nMartha gave her hand a clumsy little shake, as if she was not\r\naccustomed to this sort of thing either. Then she laughed.\r\n\r\n“Eh! th’ art a queer, old-womanish thing,” she said. “If tha’d been our\r\n’Lizabeth Ellen tha’d have given me a kiss.”\r\n\r\nMary looked stiffer than ever.\r\n\r\n“Do you want me to kiss you?”\r\n\r\nMartha laughed again.\r\n\r\n“Nay, not me,” she answered. “If tha’ was different, p’raps tha’d want\r\nto thysel’. But tha’ isn’t. Run off outside an’ play with thy rope.”\r\n\r\nMistress Mary felt a little awkward as she went out of the room.\r\nYorkshire people seemed strange, and Martha was always rather a puzzle\r\nto her. At first she had disliked her very much, but now she did not.\r\nThe skipping-rope was a wonderful thing. She counted and skipped, and\r\nskipped and counted, until her cheeks were quite red, and she was more\r\ninterested than she had ever been since she was born. The sun was\r\nshining and a little wind was blowing—not a rough wind, but one which\r\ncame in delightful little gusts and brought a fresh scent of newly\r\nturned earth with it. She skipped round the fountain garden, and up one\r\nwalk and down another. She skipped at last into the kitchen-garden and\r\nsaw Ben Weatherstaff digging and talking to his robin, which was\r\nhopping about him. She skipped down the walk toward him and he lifted\r\nhis head and looked at her with a curious expression. She had wondered\r\nif he would notice her. She wanted him to see her skip.\r\n\r\n“Well!” he exclaimed. “Upon my word. P’raps tha’ art a young ’un, after\r\nall, an’ p’raps tha’s got child’s blood in thy veins instead of sour\r\nbuttermilk. Tha’s skipped red into thy cheeks as sure as my name’s Ben\r\nWeatherstaff. I wouldn’t have believed tha’ could do it.”\r\n\r\n“I never skipped before,” Mary said. “I’m just beginning. I can only go\r\nup to twenty.”\r\n\r\n“Tha’ keep on,” said Ben. “Tha’ shapes well enough at it for a young\r\n’un that’s lived with heathen. Just see how he’s watchin’ thee,”\r\njerking his head toward the robin. “He followed after thee yesterday.\r\nHe’ll be at it again today. He’ll be bound to find out what th’\r\nskippin’-rope is. He’s never seen one. Eh!” shaking his head at the\r\nbird, “tha’ curiosity will be th’ death of thee sometime if tha’\r\ndoesn’t look sharp.”\r\n\r\nMary skipped round all the gardens and round the orchard, resting every\r\nfew minutes. At length she went to her own special walk and made up her\r\nmind to try if she could skip the whole length of it. It was a good\r\nlong skip and she began slowly, but before she had gone half-way down\r\nthe path she was so hot and breathless that she was obliged to stop.\r\nShe did not mind much, because she had already counted up to thirty.\r\nShe stopped with a little laugh of pleasure, and there, lo and behold,\r\nwas the robin swaying on a long branch of ivy. He had followed her and\r\nhe greeted her with a chirp. As Mary had skipped toward him she felt\r\nsomething heavy in her pocket strike against her at each jump, and when\r\nshe saw the robin she laughed again.\r\n\r\n“You showed me where the key was yesterday,” she said. “You ought to\r\nshow me the door today; but I don’t believe you know!”\r\n\r\nThe robin flew from his swinging spray of ivy on to the top of the wall\r\nand he opened his beak and sang a loud, lovely trill, merely to show\r\noff. Nothing in the world is quite as adorably lovely as a robin when\r\nhe shows off—and they are nearly always doing it.\r\n\r\nMary Lennox had heard a great deal about Magic in her Ayah’s stories,\r\nand she always said that what happened almost at that moment was Magic.\r\n\r\nOne of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down the walk, and it was a\r\nstronger one than the rest. It was strong enough to wave the branches\r\nof the trees, and it was more than strong enough to sway the trailing\r\nsprays of untrimmed ivy hanging from the wall. Mary had stepped close\r\nto the robin, and suddenly the gust of wind swung aside some loose ivy\r\ntrails, and more suddenly still she jumped toward it and caught it in\r\nher hand. This she did because she had seen something under it—a round\r\nknob which had been covered by the leaves hanging over it. It was the\r\nknob of a door.\r\n\r\nShe put her hands under the leaves and began to pull and push them\r\naside. Thick as the ivy hung, it nearly all was a loose and swinging\r\ncurtain, though some had crept over wood and iron. Mary’s heart began\r\nto thump and her hands to shake a little in her delight and excitement.\r\nThe robin kept singing and twittering away and tilting his head on one\r\nside, as if he were as excited as she was. What was this under her\r\nhands which was square and made of iron and which her fingers found a\r\nhole in?\r\n\r\nIt was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she put\r\nher hand in her pocket, drew out the key and found it fitted the\r\nkeyhole. She put the key in and turned it. It took two hands to do it,\r\nbut it did turn.\r\n\r\nAnd then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walk\r\nto see if anyone was coming. No one was coming. No one ever did come,\r\nit seemed, and she took another long breath, because she could not help\r\nit, and she held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back the\r\ndoor which opened slowly—slowly.\r\n\r\nThen she slipped through it, and shut it behind her, and stood with her\r\nback against it, looking about her and breathing quite fast with\r\nexcitement, and wonder, and delight.\r\n\r\nShe was standing _inside_ the secret garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\nTHE STRANGEST HOUSE ANYONE EVER LIVED IN\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place anyone could\r\nimagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless\r\nstems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were matted\r\ntogether. Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a great\r\nmany roses in India. All the ground was covered with grass of a wintry\r\nbrown and out of it grew clumps of bushes which were surely rosebushes\r\nif they were alive. There were numbers of standard roses which had so\r\nspread their branches that they were like little trees. There were\r\nother trees in the garden, and one of the things which made the place\r\nlook strangest and loveliest was that climbing roses had run all over\r\nthem and swung down long tendrils which made light swaying curtains,\r\nand here and there they had caught at each other or at a far-reaching\r\nbranch and had crept from one tree to another and made lovely bridges\r\nof themselves. There were neither leaves nor roses on them now and Mary\r\ndid not know whether they were dead or alive, but their thin gray or\r\nbrown branches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading\r\nover everything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass, where they had\r\nfallen from their fastenings and run along the ground. It was this hazy\r\ntangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious. Mary had\r\nthought it must be different from other gardens which had not been left\r\nall by themselves so long; and indeed it was different from any other\r\nplace she had ever seen in her life.\r\n\r\n“How still it is!” she whispered. “How still!”\r\n\r\nThen she waited a moment and listened at the stillness. The robin, who\r\nhad flown to his treetop, was still as all the rest. He did not even\r\nflutter his wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary.\r\n\r\n“No wonder it is still,” she whispered again. “I am the first person\r\nwho has spoken in here for ten years.”\r\n\r\nShe moved away from the door, stepping as softly as if she were afraid\r\nof awakening someone. She was glad that there was grass under her feet\r\nand that her steps made no sounds. She walked under one of the\r\nfairy-like gray arches between the trees and looked up at the sprays\r\nand tendrils which formed them.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if they are all quite dead,” she said. “Is it all a quite\r\ndead garden? I wish it wasn’t.”\r\n\r\nIf she had been Ben Weatherstaff she could have told whether the wood\r\nwas alive by looking at it, but she could only see that there were only\r\ngray or brown sprays and branches and none showed any signs of even a\r\ntiny leaf-bud anywhere.\r\n\r\nBut she was _inside_ the wonderful garden and she could come through\r\nthe door under the ivy any time and she felt as if she had found a\r\nworld all her own.\r\n\r\nThe sun was shining inside the four walls and the high arch of blue sky\r\nover this particular piece of Misselthwaite seemed even more brilliant\r\nand soft than it was over the moor. The robin flew down from his\r\ntree-top and hopped about or flew after her from one bush to another.\r\nHe chirped a good deal and had a very busy air, as if he were showing\r\nher things. Everything was strange and silent and she seemed to be\r\nhundreds of miles away from anyone, but somehow she did not feel lonely\r\nat all. All that troubled her was her wish that she knew whether all\r\nthe roses were dead, or if perhaps some of them had lived and might put\r\nout leaves and buds as the weather got warmer. She did not want it to\r\nbe a quite dead garden. If it were a quite alive garden, how wonderful\r\nit would be, and what thousands of roses would grow on every side!\r\n\r\nHer skipping-rope had hung over her arm when she came in and after she\r\nhad walked about for a while she thought she would skip round the whole\r\ngarden, stopping when she wanted to look at things. There seemed to\r\nhave been grass paths here and there, and in one or two corners there\r\nwere alcoves of evergreen with stone seats or tall moss-covered flower\r\nurns in them.\r\n\r\nAs she came near the second of these alcoves she stopped skipping.\r\nThere had once been a flowerbed in it, and she thought she saw\r\nsomething sticking out of the black earth—some sharp little pale green\r\npoints. She remembered what Ben Weatherstaff had said and she knelt\r\ndown to look at them.\r\n\r\n“Yes, they are tiny growing things and they _might_ be crocuses or\r\nsnowdrops or daffodils,” she whispered.\r\n\r\nShe bent very close to them and sniffed the fresh scent of the damp\r\nearth. She liked it very much.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps there are some other ones coming up in other places,” she\r\nsaid. “I will go all over the garden and look.”\r\n\r\nShe did not skip, but walked. She went slowly and kept her eyes on the\r\nground. She looked in the old border beds and among the grass, and\r\nafter she had gone round, trying to miss nothing, she had found ever so\r\nmany more sharp, pale green points, and she had become quite excited\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“It isn’t a quite dead garden,” she cried out softly to herself. “Even\r\nif the roses are dead, there are other things alive.”\r\n\r\nShe did not know anything about gardening, but the grass seemed so\r\nthick in some of the places where the green points were pushing their\r\nway through that she thought they did not seem to have room enough to\r\ngrow. She searched about until she found a rather sharp piece of wood\r\nand knelt down and dug and weeded out the weeds and grass until she\r\nmade nice little clear places around them.\r\n\r\n“Now they look as if they could breathe,” she said, after she had\r\nfinished with the first ones. “I am going to do ever so many more. I’ll\r\ndo all I can see. If I haven’t time today I can come tomorrow.”\r\n\r\nShe went from place to place, and dug and weeded, and enjoyed herself\r\nso immensely that she was led on from bed to bed and into the grass\r\nunder the trees. The exercise made her so warm that she first threw her\r\ncoat off, and then her hat, and without knowing it she was smiling down\r\non to the grass and the pale green points all the time.\r\n\r\nThe robin was tremendously busy. He was very much pleased to see\r\ngardening begun on his own estate. He had often wondered at Ben\r\nWeatherstaff. Where gardening is done all sorts of delightful things to\r\neat are turned up with the soil. Now here was this new kind of creature\r\nwho was not half Ben’s size and yet had had the sense to come into his\r\ngarden and begin at once.\r\n\r\nMistress Mary worked in her garden until it was time to go to her\r\nmidday dinner. In fact, she was rather late in remembering, and when\r\nshe put on her coat and hat, and picked up her skipping-rope, she could\r\nnot believe that she had been working two or three hours. She had been\r\nactually happy all the time; and dozens and dozens of the tiny, pale\r\ngreen points were to be seen in cleared places, looking twice as\r\ncheerful as they had looked before when the grass and weeds had been\r\nsmothering them.\r\n\r\n“I shall come back this afternoon,” she said, looking all round at her\r\nnew kingdom, and speaking to the trees and the rose-bushes as if they\r\nheard her.\r\n\r\nThen she ran lightly across the grass, pushed open the slow old door\r\nand slipped through it under the ivy. She had such red cheeks and such\r\nbright eyes and ate such a dinner that Martha was delighted.\r\n\r\n“Two pieces o’ meat an’ two helps o’ rice puddin’!” she said. “Eh!\r\nmother will be pleased when I tell her what th’ skippin’-rope’s done\r\nfor thee.”\r\n\r\nIn the course of her digging with her pointed stick Mistress Mary had\r\nfound herself digging up a sort of white root rather like an onion. She\r\nhad put it back in its place and patted the earth carefully down on it\r\nand just now she wondered if Martha could tell her what it was.\r\n\r\n“Martha,” she said, “what are those white roots that look like onions?”\r\n\r\n“They’re bulbs,” answered Martha. “Lots o’ spring flowers grow from\r\n’em. Th’ very little ones are snowdrops an’ crocuses an’ th’ big ones\r\nare narcissuses an’ jonquils and daffydowndillys. Th’ biggest of all is\r\nlilies an’ purple flags. Eh! they are nice. Dickon’s got a whole lot of\r\n’em planted in our bit o’ garden.”\r\n\r\n“Does Dickon know all about them?” asked Mary, a new idea taking\r\npossession of her.\r\n\r\n“Our Dickon can make a flower grow out of a brick walk. Mother says he\r\njust whispers things out o’ th’ ground.”\r\n\r\n“Do bulbs live a long time? Would they live years and years if no one\r\nhelped them?” inquired Mary anxiously.\r\n\r\n“They’re things as helps themselves,” said Martha. “That’s why poor\r\nfolk can afford to have ’em. If you don’t trouble ’em, most of ’em’ll\r\nwork away underground for a lifetime an’ spread out an’ have little\r\n’uns. There’s a place in th’ park woods here where there’s snowdrops by\r\nthousands. They’re the prettiest sight in Yorkshire when th’ spring\r\ncomes. No one knows when they was first planted.”\r\n\r\n“I wish the spring was here now,” said Mary. “I want to see all the\r\nthings that grow in England.”\r\n\r\nShe had finished her dinner and gone to her favorite seat on the\r\nhearth-rug.\r\n\r\n“I wish—I wish I had a little spade,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Whatever does tha’ want a spade for?” asked Martha, laughing. “Art\r\ntha’ goin’ to take to diggin’? I must tell mother that, too.”\r\n\r\nMary looked at the fire and pondered a little. She must be careful if\r\nshe meant to keep her secret kingdom. She wasn’t doing any harm, but if\r\nMr. Craven found out about the open door he would be fearfully angry\r\nand get a new key and lock it up forevermore. She really could not bear\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n“This is such a big lonely place,” she said slowly, as if she were\r\nturning matters over in her mind. “The house is lonely, and the park is\r\nlonely, and the gardens are lonely. So many places seem shut up. I\r\nnever did many things in India, but there were more people to look\r\nat—natives and soldiers marching by—and sometimes bands playing, and my\r\nAyah told me stories. There is no one to talk to here except you and\r\nBen Weatherstaff. And you have to do your work and Ben Weatherstaff\r\nwon’t speak to me often. I thought if I had a little spade I could dig\r\nsomewhere as he does, and I might make a little garden if he would give\r\nme some seeds.”\r\n\r\nMartha’s face quite lighted up.\r\n\r\n“There now!” she exclaimed, “if that wasn’t one of th’ things mother\r\nsaid. She says, ‘There’s such a lot o’ room in that big place, why\r\ndon’t they give her a bit for herself, even if she doesn’t plant\r\nnothin’ but parsley an’ radishes? She’d dig an’ rake away an’ be right\r\ndown happy over it.’ Them was the very words she said.”\r\n\r\n“Were they?” said Mary. “How many things she knows, doesn’t she?”\r\n\r\n“Eh!” said Martha. “It’s like she says: ‘A woman as brings up twelve\r\nchildren learns something besides her A B C. Children’s as good as\r\n’rithmetic to set you findin’ out things.’”\r\n\r\n“How much would a spade cost—a little one?” Mary asked.\r\n\r\n“Well,” was Martha’s reflective answer, “at Thwaite village there’s a\r\nshop or so an’ I saw little garden sets with a spade an’ a rake an’ a\r\nfork all tied together for two shillings. An’ they was stout enough to\r\nwork with, too.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got more than that in my purse,” said Mary. “Mrs. Morrison gave\r\nme five shillings and Mrs. Medlock gave me some money from Mr. Craven.”\r\n\r\n“Did he remember thee that much?” exclaimed Martha.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Medlock said I was to have a shilling a week to spend. She gives\r\nme one every Saturday. I didn’t know what to spend it on.”\r\n\r\n“My word! that’s riches,” said Martha. “Tha’ can buy anything in th’\r\nworld tha’ wants. Th’ rent of our cottage is only one an’ threepence\r\nan’ it’s like pullin’ eye-teeth to get it. Now I’ve just thought of\r\nsomethin’,” putting her hands on her hips.\r\n\r\n“What?” said Mary eagerly.\r\n\r\n“In the shop at Thwaite they sell packages o’ flower-seeds for a penny\r\neach, and our Dickon he knows which is th’ prettiest ones an’ how to\r\nmake ’em grow. He walks over to Thwaite many a day just for th’ fun of\r\nit. Does tha’ know how to print letters?” suddenly.\r\n\r\n“I know how to write,” Mary answered.\r\n\r\nMartha shook her head.\r\n\r\n“Our Dickon can only read printin’. If tha’ could print we could write\r\na letter to him an’ ask him to go an’ buy th’ garden tools an’ th’\r\nseeds at th’ same time.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! you’re a good girl!” Mary cried. “You are, really! I didn’t know\r\nyou were so nice. I know I can print letters if I try. Let’s ask Mrs.\r\nMedlock for a pen and ink and some paper.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve got some of my own,” said Martha. “I bought ’em so I could print\r\na bit of a letter to mother of a Sunday. I’ll go and get it.”\r\n\r\nShe ran out of the room, and Mary stood by the fire and twisted her\r\nthin little hands together with sheer pleasure.\r\n\r\n“If I have a spade,” she whispered, “I can make the earth nice and soft\r\nand dig up weeds. If I have seeds and can make flowers grow the garden\r\nwon’t be dead at all—it will come alive.”\r\n\r\nShe did not go out again that afternoon because when Martha returned\r\nwith her pen and ink and paper she was obliged to clear the table and\r\ncarry the plates and dishes downstairs and when she got into the\r\nkitchen Mrs. Medlock was there and told her to do something, so Mary\r\nwaited for what seemed to her a long time before she came back. Then it\r\nwas a serious piece of work to write to Dickon. Mary had been taught\r\nvery little because her governesses had disliked her too much to stay\r\nwith her. She could not spell particularly well but she found that she\r\ncould print letters when she tried. This was the letter Martha dictated\r\nto her:\r\n\r\n\r\n“_My Dear Dickon:_\r\n\r\nThis comes hoping to find you well as it leaves me at present. Miss\r\nMary has plenty of money and will you go to Thwaite and buy her some\r\nflower seeds and a set of garden tools to make a flower-bed. Pick the\r\nprettiest ones and easy to grow because she has never done it before\r\nand lived in India which is different. Give my love to mother and\r\neveryone of you. Miss Mary is going to tell me a lot more so that on my\r\nnext day out you can hear about elephants and camels and gentlemen\r\ngoing hunting lions and tigers.\r\n\r\n    “Your loving sister,\r\n\r\n                “Martha Phœbe Sowerby.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll put the money in th’ envelope an’ I’ll get th’ butcher boy to\r\ntake it in his cart. He’s a great friend o’ Dickon’s,” said Martha.\r\n\r\n“How shall I get the things when Dickon buys them?”\r\n\r\n“He’ll bring ’em to you himself. He’ll like to walk over this way.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” exclaimed Mary, “then I shall see him! I never thought I should\r\nsee Dickon.”\r\n\r\n“Does tha’ want to see him?” asked Martha suddenly, for Mary had looked\r\nso pleased.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do. I never saw a boy foxes and crows loved. I want to see him\r\nvery much.”\r\n\r\nMartha gave a little start, as if she remembered something.\r\n\r\n“Now to think,” she broke out, “to think o’ me forgettin’ that there;\r\nan’ I thought I was goin’ to tell you first thing this mornin’. I asked\r\nmother—and she said she’d ask Mrs. Medlock her own self.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean—” Mary began.\r\n\r\n“What I said Tuesday. Ask her if you might be driven over to our\r\ncottage some day and have a bit o’ mother’s hot oat cake, an’ butter,\r\nan’ a glass o’ milk.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if all the interesting things were happening in one day.\r\nTo think of going over the moor in the daylight and when the sky was\r\nblue! To think of going into the cottage which held twelve children!\r\n\r\n“Does she think Mrs. Medlock would let me go?” she asked, quite\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n“Aye, she thinks she would. She knows what a tidy woman mother is and\r\nhow clean she keeps the cottage.”\r\n\r\n“If I went I should see your mother as well as Dickon,” said Mary,\r\nthinking it over and liking the idea very much. “She doesn’t seem to be\r\nlike the mothers in India.”\r\n\r\nHer work in the garden and the excitement of the afternoon ended by\r\nmaking her feel quiet and thoughtful. Martha stayed with her until\r\ntea-time, but they sat in comfortable quiet and talked very little. But\r\njust before Martha went downstairs for the tea-tray, Mary asked a\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“Martha,” she said, “has the scullery-maid had the toothache again\r\ntoday?”\r\n\r\nMartha certainly started slightly.\r\n\r\n“What makes thee ask that?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Because when I waited so long for you to come back I opened the door\r\nand walked down the corridor to see if you were coming. And I heard\r\nthat far-off crying again, just as we heard it the other night. There\r\nisn’t a wind today, so you see it couldn’t have been the wind.”\r\n\r\n“Eh!” said Martha restlessly. “Tha’ mustn’t go walkin’ about in\r\ncorridors an’ listenin’. Mr. Craven would be that there angry there’s\r\nno knowin’ what he’d do.”\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t listening,” said Mary. “I was just waiting for you—and I\r\nheard it. That’s three times.”\r\n\r\n“My word! There’s Mrs. Medlock’s bell,” said Martha, and she almost ran\r\nout of the room.\r\n\r\n“It’s the strangest house anyone ever lived in,” said Mary drowsily, as\r\nshe dropped her head on the cushioned seat of the armchair near her.\r\nFresh air, and digging, and skipping-rope had made her feel so\r\ncomfortably tired that she fell asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\nDICKON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun shone down for nearly a week on the secret garden. The Secret\r\nGarden was what Mary called it when she was thinking of it. She liked\r\nthe name, and she liked still more the feeling that when its beautiful\r\nold walls shut her in no one knew where she was. It seemed almost like\r\nbeing shut out of the world in some fairy place. The few books she had\r\nread and liked had been fairy-story books, and she had read of secret\r\ngardens in some of the stories. Sometimes people went to sleep in them\r\nfor a hundred years, which she had thought must be rather stupid. She\r\nhad no intention of going to sleep, and, in fact, she was becoming\r\nwider awake every day which passed at Misselthwaite. She was beginning\r\nto like to be out of doors; she no longer hated the wind, but enjoyed\r\nit. She could run faster, and longer, and she could skip up to a\r\nhundred. The bulbs in the secret garden must have been much astonished.\r\nSuch nice clear places were made round them that they had all the\r\nbreathing space they wanted, and really, if Mistress Mary had known it,\r\nthey began to cheer up under the dark earth and work tremendously. The\r\nsun could get at them and warm them, and when the rain came down it\r\ncould reach them at once, so they began to feel very much alive.\r\n\r\nMary was an odd, determined little person, and now she had something\r\ninteresting to be determined about, she was very much absorbed, indeed.\r\nShe worked and dug and pulled up weeds steadily, only becoming more\r\npleased with her work every hour instead of tiring of it. It seemed to\r\nher like a fascinating sort of play. She found many more of the\r\nsprouting pale green points than she had ever hoped to find. They\r\nseemed to be starting up everywhere and each day she was sure she found\r\ntiny new ones, some so tiny that they barely peeped above the earth.\r\nThere were so many that she remembered what Martha had said about the\r\n“snowdrops by the thousands,” and about bulbs spreading and making new\r\nones. These had been left to themselves for ten years and perhaps they\r\nhad spread, like the snowdrops, into thousands. She wondered how long\r\nit would be before they showed that they were flowers. Sometimes she\r\nstopped digging to look at the garden and try to imagine what it would\r\nbe like when it was covered with thousands of lovely things in bloom.\r\n\r\nDuring that week of sunshine, she became more intimate with Ben\r\nWeatherstaff. She surprised him several times by seeming to start up\r\nbeside him as if she sprang out of the earth. The truth was that she\r\nwas afraid that he would pick up his tools and go away if he saw her\r\ncoming, so she always walked toward him as silently as possible. But,\r\nin fact, he did not object to her as strongly as he had at first.\r\nPerhaps he was secretly rather flattered by her evident desire for his\r\nelderly company. Then, also, she was more civil than she had been. He\r\ndid not know that when she first saw him she spoke to him as she would\r\nhave spoken to a native, and had not known that a cross, sturdy old\r\nYorkshire man was not accustomed to salaam to his masters, and be\r\nmerely commanded by them to do things.\r\n\r\n“Tha’rt like th’ robin,” he said to her one morning when he lifted his\r\nhead and saw her standing by him. “I never knows when I shall see thee\r\nor which side tha’ll come from.”\r\n\r\n“He’s friends with me now,” said Mary.\r\n\r\n“That’s like him,” snapped Ben Weatherstaff. “Makin’ up to th’ women\r\nfolk just for vanity an’ flightiness. There’s nothin’ he wouldn’t do\r\nfor th’ sake o’ showin’ off an’ flirtin’ his tail-feathers. He’s as\r\nfull o’ pride as an egg’s full o’ meat.”\r\n\r\nHe very seldom talked much and sometimes did not even answer Mary’s\r\nquestions except by a grunt, but this morning he said more than usual.\r\nHe stood up and rested one hobnailed boot on the top of his spade while\r\nhe looked her over.\r\n\r\n“How long has tha’ been here?” he jerked out.\r\n\r\n“I think it’s about a month,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“Tha’s beginnin’ to do Misselthwaite credit,” he said. “Tha’s a bit\r\nfatter than tha’ was an’ tha’s not quite so yeller. Tha’ looked like a\r\nyoung plucked crow when tha’ first came into this garden. Thinks I to\r\nmyself I never set eyes on an uglier, sourer faced young ’un.”\r\n\r\nMary was not vain and as she had never thought much of her looks she\r\nwas not greatly disturbed.\r\n\r\n“I know I’m fatter,” she said. “My stockings are getting tighter. They\r\nused to make wrinkles. There’s the robin, Ben Weatherstaff.”\r\n\r\nThere, indeed, was the robin, and she thought he looked nicer than\r\never. His red waistcoat was as glossy as satin and he flirted his wings\r\nand tail and tilted his head and hopped about with all sorts of lively\r\ngraces. He seemed determined to make Ben Weatherstaff admire him. But\r\nBen was sarcastic.\r\n\r\n“Aye, there tha’ art!” he said. “Tha’ can put up with me for a bit\r\nsometimes when tha’s got no one better. Tha’s been reddenin’ up thy\r\nwaistcoat an’ polishin’ thy feathers this two weeks. I know what tha’s\r\nup to. Tha’s courtin’ some bold young madam somewhere tellin’ thy lies\r\nto her about bein’ th’ finest cock robin on Missel Moor an’ ready to\r\nfight all th’ rest of ’em.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! look at him!” exclaimed Mary.\r\n\r\nThe robin was evidently in a fascinating, bold mood. He hopped closer\r\nand closer and looked at Ben Weatherstaff more and more engagingly. He\r\nflew on to the nearest currant bush and tilted his head and sang a\r\nlittle song right at him.\r\n\r\n“Tha’ thinks tha’ll get over me by doin’ that,” said Ben, wrinkling his\r\nface up in such a way that Mary felt sure he was trying not to look\r\npleased. “Tha’ thinks no one can stand out against thee—that’s what\r\ntha’ thinks.”\r\n\r\nThe robin spread his wings—Mary could scarcely believe her eyes. He\r\nflew right up to the handle of Ben Weatherstaff’s spade and alighted on\r\nthe top of it. Then the old man’s face wrinkled itself slowly into a\r\nnew expression. He stood still as if he were afraid to breathe—as if he\r\nwould not have stirred for the world, lest his robin should start away.\r\nHe spoke quite in a whisper.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’m danged!” he said as softly as if he were saying something\r\nquite different. “Tha’ does know how to get at a chap—tha’ does! Tha’s\r\nfair unearthly, tha’s so knowin’.”\r\n\r\nAnd he stood without stirring—almost without drawing his breath—until\r\nthe robin gave another flirt to his wings and flew away. Then he stood\r\nlooking at the handle of the spade as if there might be Magic in it,\r\nand then he began to dig again and said nothing for several minutes.\r\n\r\nBut because he kept breaking into a slow grin now and then, Mary was\r\nnot afraid to talk to him.\r\n\r\n“Have you a garden of your own?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“No. I’m bachelder an’ lodge with Martin at th’ gate.”\r\n\r\n“If you had one,” said Mary, “what would you plant?”\r\n\r\n“Cabbages an’ ’taters an’ onions.”\r\n\r\n“But if you wanted to make a flower garden,” persisted Mary, “what\r\nwould you plant?”\r\n\r\n“Bulbs an’ sweet-smellin’ things—but mostly roses.”\r\n\r\nMary’s face lighted up.\r\n\r\n“Do you like roses?” she said.\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff rooted up a weed and threw it aside before he\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n“Well, yes, I do. I was learned that by a young lady I was gardener to.\r\nShe had a lot in a place she was fond of, an’ she loved ’em like they\r\nwas children—or robins. I’ve seen her bend over an’ kiss ’em.” He\r\ndragged out another weed and scowled at it. “That were as much as ten\r\nyear’ ago.”\r\n\r\n“Where is she now?” asked Mary, much interested.\r\n\r\n“Heaven,” he answered, and drove his spade deep into the soil,\r\n“’cording to what parson says.”\r\n\r\n“What happened to the roses?” Mary asked again, more interested than\r\never.\r\n\r\n“They was left to themselves.”\r\n\r\nMary was becoming quite excited.\r\n\r\n“Did they quite die? Do roses quite die when they are left to\r\nthemselves?” she ventured.\r\n\r\n“Well, I’d got to like ’em—an’ I liked her—an’ she liked ’em,” Ben\r\nWeatherstaff admitted reluctantly. “Once or twice a year I’d go an’\r\nwork at ’em a bit—prune ’em an’ dig about th’ roots. They run wild, but\r\nthey was in rich soil, so some of ’em lived.”\r\n\r\n“When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry, how can you\r\ntell whether they are dead or alive?” inquired Mary.\r\n\r\n“Wait till th’ spring gets at ’em—wait till th’ sun shines on th’ rain\r\nand th’ rain falls on th’ sunshine an’ then tha’ll find out.”\r\n\r\n“How—how?” cried Mary, forgetting to be careful.\r\n\r\n“Look along th’ twigs an’ branches an’ if tha’ see a bit of a brown\r\nlump swelling here an’ there, watch it after th’ warm rain an’ see what\r\nhappens.” He stopped suddenly and looked curiously at her eager face.\r\n“Why does tha’ care so much about roses an’ such, all of a sudden?” he\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nMistress Mary felt her face grow red. She was almost afraid to answer.\r\n\r\n“I—I want to play that—that I have a garden of my own,” she stammered.\r\n“I—there is nothing for me to do. I have nothing—and no one.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Ben Weatherstaff slowly, as he watched her, “that’s true.\r\nTha’ hasn’t.”\r\n\r\nHe said it in such an odd way that Mary wondered if he was actually a\r\nlittle sorry for her. She had never felt sorry for herself; she had\r\nonly felt tired and cross, because she disliked people and things so\r\nmuch. But now the world seemed to be changing and getting nicer. If no\r\none found out about the secret garden, she should enjoy herself always.\r\n\r\nShe stayed with him for ten or fifteen minutes longer and asked him as\r\nmany questions as she dared. He answered everyone of them in his queer\r\ngrunting way and he did not seem really cross and did not pick up his\r\nspade and leave her. He said something about roses just as she was\r\ngoing away and it reminded her of the ones he had said he had been fond\r\nof.\r\n\r\n“Do you go and see those other roses now?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Not been this year. My rheumatics has made me too stiff in th’\r\njoints.”\r\n\r\nHe said it in his grumbling voice, and then quite suddenly he seemed to\r\nget angry with her, though she did not see why he should.\r\n\r\n“Now look here!” he said sharply. “Don’t tha’ ask so many questions.\r\nTha’rt th’ worst wench for askin’ questions I’ve ever come across. Get\r\nthee gone an’ play thee. I’ve done talkin’ for today.”\r\n\r\nAnd he said it so crossly that she knew there was not the least use in\r\nstaying another minute. She went skipping slowly down the outside walk,\r\nthinking him over and saying to herself that, queer as it was, here was\r\nanother person whom she liked in spite of his crossness. She liked old\r\nBen Weatherstaff. Yes, she did like him. She always wanted to try to\r\nmake him talk to her. Also she began to believe that he knew everything\r\nin the world about flowers.\r\n\r\nThere was a laurel-hedged walk which curved round the secret garden and\r\nended at a gate which opened into a wood, in the park. She thought she\r\nwould slip round this walk and look into the wood and see if there were\r\nany rabbits hopping about. She enjoyed the skipping very much and when\r\nshe reached the little gate she opened it and went through because she\r\nheard a low, peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find out what it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nIt was a very strange thing indeed. She quite caught her breath as she\r\nstopped to look at it. A boy was sitting under a tree, with his back\r\nagainst it, playing on a rough wooden pipe. He was a funny looking boy\r\nabout twelve. He looked very clean and his nose turned up and his\r\ncheeks were as red as poppies and never had Mistress Mary seen such\r\nround and such blue eyes in any boy’s face. And on the trunk of the\r\ntree he leaned against, a brown squirrel was clinging and watching him,\r\nand from behind a bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching\r\nhis neck to peep out, and quite near him were two rabbits sitting up\r\nand sniffing with tremulous noses—and actually it appeared as if they\r\nwere all drawing near to watch him and listen to the strange low little\r\ncall his pipe seemed to make.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw Mary he held up his hand and spoke to her in a voice almost\r\nas low as and rather like his piping.\r\n\r\n“Don’t tha’ move,” he said. “It’d flight ’em.”\r\n\r\nMary remained motionless. He stopped playing his pipe and began to rise\r\nfrom the ground. He moved so slowly that it scarcely seemed as though\r\nhe were moving at all, but at last he stood on his feet and then the\r\nsquirrel scampered back up into the branches of his tree, the pheasant\r\nwithdrew his head and the rabbits dropped on all fours and began to hop\r\naway, though not at all as if they were frightened.\r\n\r\n“I’m Dickon,” the boy said. “I know tha’rt Miss Mary.”\r\n\r\nThen Mary realized that somehow she had known at first that he was\r\nDickon. Who else could have been charming rabbits and pheasants as the\r\nnatives charm snakes in India? He had a wide, red, curving mouth and\r\nhis smile spread all over his face.\r\n\r\n“I got up slow,” he explained, “because if tha’ makes a quick move it\r\nstartles ’em. A body ’as to move gentle an’ speak low when wild things\r\nis about.”\r\n\r\nHe did not speak to her as if they had never seen each other before but\r\nas if he knew her quite well. Mary knew nothing about boys and she\r\nspoke to him a little stiffly because she felt rather shy.\r\n\r\n“Did you get Martha’s letter?” she asked.\r\n\r\nHe nodded his curly, rust-colored head.\r\n\r\n“That’s why I come.”\r\n\r\nHe stooped to pick up something which had been lying on the ground\r\nbeside him when he piped.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got th’ garden tools. There’s a little spade an’ rake an’ a fork\r\nan’ hoe. Eh! they are good ’uns. There’s a trowel, too. An’ th’ woman\r\nin th’ shop threw in a packet o’ white poppy an’ one o’ blue larkspur\r\nwhen I bought th’ other seeds.”\r\n\r\n“Will you show the seeds to me?” Mary said.\r\n\r\nShe wished she could talk as he did. His speech was so quick and easy.\r\nIt sounded as if he liked her and was not the least afraid she would\r\nnot like him, though he was only a common moor boy, in patched clothes\r\nand with a funny face and a rough, rusty-red head. As she came closer\r\nto him she noticed that there was a clean fresh scent of heather and\r\ngrass and leaves about him, almost as if he were made of them. She\r\nliked it very much and when she looked into his funny face with the red\r\ncheeks and round blue eyes she forgot that she had felt shy.\r\n\r\n“Let us sit down on this log and look at them,” she said.\r\n\r\nThey sat down and he took a clumsy little brown paper package out of\r\nhis coat pocket. He untied the string and inside there were ever so\r\nmany neater and smaller packages with a picture of a flower on each\r\none.\r\n\r\n“There’s a lot o’ mignonette an’ poppies,” he said. “Mignonette’s th’\r\nsweetest smellin’ thing as grows, an’ it’ll grow wherever you cast it,\r\nsame as poppies will. Them as’ll come up an’ bloom if you just whistle\r\nto ’em, them’s th’ nicest of all.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped and turned his head quickly, his poppy-cheeked face lighting\r\nup.\r\n\r\n“Where’s that robin as is callin’ us?” he said.\r\n\r\nThe chirp came from a thick holly bush, bright with scarlet berries,\r\nand Mary thought she knew whose it was.\r\n\r\n“Is it really calling us?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Aye,” said Dickon, as if it was the most natural thing in the world,\r\n“he’s callin’ someone he’s friends with. That’s same as sayin’ ‘Here I\r\nam. Look at me. I wants a bit of a chat.’ There he is in the bush.\r\nWhose is he?”\r\n\r\n“He’s Ben Weatherstaff’s, but I think he knows me a little,” answered\r\nMary.\r\n\r\n“Aye, he knows thee,” said Dickon in his low voice again. “An’ he likes\r\nthee. He’s took thee on. He’ll tell me all about thee in a minute.”\r\n\r\nHe moved quite close to the bush with the slow movement Mary had\r\nnoticed before, and then he made a sound almost like the robin’s own\r\ntwitter. The robin listened a few seconds, intently, and then answered\r\nquite as if he were replying to a question.\r\n\r\n“Aye, he’s a friend o’ yours,” chuckled Dickon.\r\n\r\n“Do you think he is?” cried Mary eagerly. She did so want to know. “Do\r\nyou think he really likes me?”\r\n\r\n“He wouldn’t come near thee if he didn’t,” answered Dickon. “Birds is\r\nrare choosers an’ a robin can flout a body worse than a man. See, he’s\r\nmaking up to thee now. ‘Cannot tha’ see a chap?’ he’s sayin’.”\r\n\r\nAnd it really seemed as if it must be true. He so sidled and twittered\r\nand tilted as he hopped on his bush.\r\n\r\n“Do you understand everything birds say?” said Mary.\r\n\r\nDickon’s grin spread until he seemed all wide, red, curving mouth, and\r\nhe rubbed his rough head.\r\n\r\n“I think I do, and they think I do,” he said. “I’ve lived on th’ moor\r\nwith ’em so long. I’ve watched ’em break shell an’ come out an’ fledge\r\nan’ learn to fly an’ begin to sing, till I think I’m one of ’em.\r\nSometimes I think p’raps I’m a bird, or a fox, or a rabbit, or a\r\nsquirrel, or even a beetle, an’ I don’t know it.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed and came back to the log and began to talk about the flower\r\nseeds again. He told her what they looked like when they were flowers;\r\nhe told her how to plant them, and watch them, and feed and water them.\r\n\r\n“See here,” he said suddenly, turning round to look at her. “I’ll plant\r\nthem for thee myself. Where is tha’ garden?”\r\n\r\nMary’s thin hands clutched each other as they lay on her lap. She did\r\nnot know what to say, so for a whole minute she said nothing. She had\r\nnever thought of this. She felt miserable. And she felt as if she went\r\nred and then pale.\r\n\r\n“Tha’s got a bit o’ garden, hasn’t tha’?” Dickon said.\r\n\r\nIt was true that she had turned red and then pale. Dickon saw her do\r\nit, and as she still said nothing, he began to be puzzled.\r\n\r\n“Wouldn’t they give thee a bit?” he asked. “Hasn’t tha’ got any yet?”\r\n\r\nShe held her hands tighter and turned her eyes toward him.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know anything about boys,” she said slowly. “Could you keep a\r\nsecret, if I told you one? It’s a great secret. I don’t know what I\r\nshould do if anyone found it out. I believe I should die!” She said the\r\nlast sentence quite fiercely.\r\n\r\nDickon looked more puzzled than ever and even rubbed his hand over his\r\nrough head again, but he answered quite good-humoredly.\r\n\r\n“I’m keepin’ secrets all th’ time,” he said. “If I couldn’t keep\r\nsecrets from th’ other lads, secrets about foxes’ cubs, an’ birds’\r\nnests, an’ wild things’ holes, there’d be naught safe on th’ moor. Aye,\r\nI can keep secrets.”\r\n\r\nMistress Mary did not mean to put out her hand and clutch his sleeve\r\nbut she did it.\r\n\r\n“I’ve stolen a garden,” she said very fast. “It isn’t mine. It isn’t\r\nanybody’s. Nobody wants it, nobody cares for it, nobody ever goes into\r\nit. Perhaps everything is dead in it already. I don’t know.”\r\n\r\nShe began to feel hot and as contrary as she had ever felt in her life.\r\n\r\n“I don’t care, I don’t care! Nobody has any right to take it from me\r\nwhen I care about it and they don’t. They’re letting it die, all shut\r\nin by itself,” she ended passionately, and she threw her arms over her\r\nface and burst out crying—poor little Mistress Mary.\r\n\r\nDickon’s curious blue eyes grew rounder and rounder.\r\n\r\n“Eh-h-h!” he said, drawing his exclamation out slowly, and the way he\r\ndid it meant both wonder and sympathy.\r\n\r\n“I’ve nothing to do,” said Mary. “Nothing belongs to me. I found it\r\nmyself and I got into it myself. I was only just like the robin, and\r\nthey wouldn’t take it from the robin.”\r\n\r\n“Where is it?” asked Dickon in a dropped voice.\r\n\r\nMistress Mary got up from the log at once. She knew she felt contrary\r\nagain, and obstinate, and she did not care at all. She was imperious\r\nand Indian, and at the same time hot and sorrowful.\r\n\r\n“Come with me and I’ll show you,” she said.\r\n\r\nShe led him round the laurel path and to the walk where the ivy grew so\r\nthickly. Dickon followed her with a queer, almost pitying, look on his\r\nface. He felt as if he were being led to look at some strange bird’s\r\nnest and must move softly. When she stepped to the wall and lifted the\r\nhanging ivy he started. There was a door and Mary pushed it slowly open\r\nand they passed in together, and then Mary stood and waved her hand\r\nround defiantly.\r\n\r\n“It’s this,” she said. “It’s a secret garden, and I’m the only one in\r\nthe world who wants it to be alive.”\r\n\r\nDickon looked round and round about it, and round and round again.\r\n\r\n“Eh!” he almost whispered, “it is a queer, pretty place! It’s like as\r\nif a body was in a dream.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\nTHE NEST OF THE MISSEL THRUSH\r\n\r\n\r\nFor two or three minutes he stood looking round him, while Mary watched\r\nhim, and then he began to walk about softly, even more lightly than\r\nMary had walked the first time she had found herself inside the four\r\nwalls. His eyes seemed to be taking in everything—the gray trees with\r\nthe gray creepers climbing over them and hanging from their branches,\r\nthe tangle on the walls and among the grass, the evergreen alcoves with\r\nthe stone seats and tall flower urns standing in them.\r\n\r\n“I never thought I’d see this place,” he said at last, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n“Did you know about it?” asked Mary.\r\n\r\nShe had spoken aloud and he made a sign to her.\r\n\r\n“We must talk low,” he said, “or someone’ll hear us an’ wonder what’s\r\nto do in here.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I forgot!” said Mary, feeling frightened and putting her hand\r\nquickly against her mouth. “Did you know about the garden?” she asked\r\nagain when she had recovered herself.\r\n\r\nDickon nodded.\r\n\r\n“Martha told me there was one as no one ever went inside,” he answered.\r\n“Us used to wonder what it was like.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped and looked round at the lovely gray tangle about him, and\r\nhis round eyes looked queerly happy.\r\n\r\n“Eh! the nests as’ll be here come springtime,” he said. “It’d be th’\r\nsafest nestin’ place in England. No one never comin’ near an’ tangles\r\no’ trees an’ roses to build in. I wonder all th’ birds on th’ moor\r\ndon’t build here.”\r\n\r\nMistress Mary put her hand on his arm again without knowing it.\r\n\r\n“Will there be roses?” she whispered. “Can you tell? I thought perhaps\r\nthey were all dead.”\r\n\r\n“Eh! No! Not them—not all of ’em!” he answered. “Look here!”\r\n\r\nHe stepped over to the nearest tree—an old, old one with gray lichen\r\nall over its bark, but upholding a curtain of tangled sprays and\r\nbranches. He took a thick knife out of his pocket and opened one of its\r\nblades.\r\n\r\n“There’s lots o’ dead wood as ought to be cut out,” he said. “An’\r\nthere’s a lot o’ old wood, but it made some new last year. This here’s\r\na new bit,” and he touched a shoot which looked brownish green instead\r\nof hard, dry gray.\r\n\r\nMary touched it herself in an eager, reverent way.\r\n\r\n“That one?” she said. “Is that one quite alive quite?”\r\n\r\nDickon curved his wide smiling mouth.\r\n\r\n“It’s as wick as you or me,” he said; and Mary remembered that Martha\r\nhad told her that “wick” meant “alive” or “lively.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad it’s wick!” she cried out in her whisper. “I want them all to\r\nbe wick. Let us go round the garden and count how many wick ones there\r\nare.”\r\n\r\nShe quite panted with eagerness, and Dickon was as eager as she was.\r\nThey went from tree to tree and from bush to bush. Dickon carried his\r\nknife in his hand and showed her things which she thought wonderful.\r\n\r\n“They’ve run wild,” he said, “but th’ strongest ones has fair thrived\r\non it. The delicatest ones has died out, but th’ others has growed an’\r\ngrowed, an’ spread an’ spread, till they’s a wonder. See here!” and he\r\npulled down a thick gray, dry-looking branch. “A body might think this\r\nwas dead wood, but I don’t believe it is—down to th’ root. I’ll cut it\r\nlow down an’ see.”\r\n\r\nHe knelt and with his knife cut the lifeless-looking branch through,\r\nnot far above the earth.\r\n\r\n“There!” he said exultantly. “I told thee so. There’s green in that\r\nwood yet. Look at it.”\r\n\r\nMary was down on her knees before he spoke, gazing with all her might.\r\n\r\n“When it looks a bit greenish an’ juicy like that, it’s wick,” he\r\nexplained. “When th’ inside is dry an’ breaks easy, like this here\r\npiece I’ve cut off, it’s done for. There’s a big root here as all this\r\nlive wood sprung out of, an’ if th’ old wood’s cut off an’ it’s dug\r\nround, and took care of there’ll be—” he stopped and lifted his face to\r\nlook up at the climbing and hanging sprays above him—“there’ll be a\r\nfountain o’ roses here this summer.”\r\n\r\nThey went from bush to bush and from tree to tree. He was very strong\r\nand clever with his knife and knew how to cut the dry and dead wood\r\naway, and could tell when an unpromising bough or twig had still green\r\nlife in it. In the course of half an hour Mary thought she could tell\r\ntoo, and when he cut through a lifeless-looking branch she would cry\r\nout joyfully under her breath when she caught sight of the least shade\r\nof moist green. The spade, and hoe, and fork were very useful. He\r\nshowed her how to use the fork while he dug about roots with the spade\r\nand stirred the earth and let the air in.\r\n\r\nThey were working industriously round one of the biggest standard roses\r\nwhen he caught sight of something which made him utter an exclamation\r\nof surprise.\r\n\r\n“Why!” he cried, pointing to the grass a few feet away. “Who did that\r\nthere?”\r\n\r\nIt was one of Mary’s own little clearings round the pale green points.\r\n\r\n“I did it,” said Mary.\r\n\r\n“Why, I thought tha’ didn’t know nothin’ about gardenin’,” he\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\n“I don’t,” she answered, “but they were so little, and the grass was so\r\nthick and strong, and they looked as if they had no room to breathe. So\r\nI made a place for them. I don’t even know what they are.”\r\n\r\nDickon went and knelt down by them, smiling his wide smile.\r\n\r\n“Tha’ was right,” he said. “A gardener couldn’t have told thee better.\r\nThey’ll grow now like Jack’s bean-stalk. They’re crocuses an’\r\nsnowdrops, an’ these here is narcissuses,” turning to another patch,\r\n“an here’s daffydowndillys. Eh! they will be a sight.”\r\n\r\nHe ran from one clearing to another.\r\n\r\n“Tha’ has done a lot o’ work for such a little wench,” he said, looking\r\nher over.\r\n\r\n“I’m growing fatter,” said Mary, “and I’m growing stronger. I used\r\nalways to be tired. When I dig I’m not tired at all. I like to smell\r\nthe earth when it’s turned up.”\r\n\r\n“It’s rare good for thee,” he said, nodding his head wisely. “There’s\r\nnaught as nice as th’ smell o’ good clean earth, except th’ smell o’\r\nfresh growin’ things when th’ rain falls on ’em. I get out on th’ moor\r\nmany a day when it’s rainin’ an’ I lie under a bush an’ listen to th’\r\nsoft swish o’ drops on th’ heather an’ I just sniff an’ sniff. My nose\r\nend fair quivers like a rabbit’s, mother says.”\r\n\r\n“Do you never catch cold?” inquired Mary, gazing at him wonderingly.\r\nShe had never seen such a funny boy, or such a nice one.\r\n\r\n“Not me,” he said, grinning. “I never ketched cold since I was born. I\r\nwasn’t brought up nesh enough. I’ve chased about th’ moor in all\r\nweathers same as th’ rabbits does. Mother says I’ve sniffed up too much\r\nfresh air for twelve year’ to ever get to sniffin’ with cold. I’m as\r\ntough as a white-thorn knobstick.”\r\n\r\nHe was working all the time he was talking and Mary was following him\r\nand helping him with her fork or the trowel.\r\n\r\n“There’s a lot of work to do here!” he said once, looking about quite\r\nexultantly.\r\n\r\n“Will you come again and help me to do it?” Mary begged. “I’m sure I\r\ncan help, too. I can dig and pull up weeds, and do whatever you tell\r\nme. Oh! do come, Dickon!”\r\n\r\n“I’ll come every day if tha’ wants me, rain or shine,” he answered\r\nstoutly. “It’s the best fun I ever had in my life—shut in here an’\r\nwakenin’ up a garden.”\r\n\r\n“If you will come,” said Mary, “if you will help me to make it alive\r\nI’ll—I don’t know what I’ll do,” she ended helplessly. What could you\r\ndo for a boy like that?\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell thee what tha’ll do,” said Dickon, with his happy grin.\r\n“Tha’ll get fat an’ tha’ll get as hungry as a young fox an’ tha’ll\r\nlearn how to talk to th’ robin same as I do. Eh! we’ll have a lot o’\r\nfun.”\r\n\r\nHe began to walk about, looking up in the trees and at the walls and\r\nbushes with a thoughtful expression.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn’t want to make it look like a gardener’s garden, all clipped\r\nan’ spick an’ span, would you?” he said. “It’s nicer like this with\r\nthings runnin’ wild, an’ swingin’ an’ catchin’ hold of each other.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t let us make it tidy,” said Mary anxiously. “It wouldn’t seem\r\nlike a secret garden if it was tidy.”\r\n\r\nDickon stood rubbing his rusty-red head with a rather puzzled look.\r\n\r\n“It’s a secret garden sure enough,” he said, “but seems like someone\r\nbesides th’ robin must have been in it since it was shut up ten year’\r\nago.”\r\n\r\n“But the door was locked and the key was buried,” said Mary. “No one\r\ncould get in.”\r\n\r\n“That’s true,” he answered. “It’s a queer place. Seems to me as if\r\nthere’d been a bit o’ prunin’ done here an’ there, later than ten year’\r\nago.”\r\n\r\n“But how could it have been done?” said Mary.\r\n\r\nHe was examining a branch of a standard rose and he shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Aye! how could it!” he murmured. “With th’ door locked an’ th’ key\r\nburied.”\r\n\r\nMistress Mary always felt that however many years she lived she should\r\nnever forget that first morning when her garden began to grow. Of\r\ncourse, it did seem to begin to grow for her that morning. When Dickon\r\nbegan to clear places to plant seeds, she remembered what Basil had\r\nsung at her when he wanted to tease her.\r\n\r\n“Are there any flowers that look like bells?” she inquired.\r\n\r\n“Lilies o’ th’ valley does,” he answered, digging away with the trowel,\r\n“an’ there’s Canterbury bells, an’ campanulas.”\r\n\r\n“Let’s plant some,” said Mary.\r\n\r\n“There’s lilies o’ th, valley here already; I saw ’em. They’ll have\r\ngrowed too close an’ we’ll have to separate ’em, but there’s plenty.\r\nTh’ other ones takes two years to bloom from seed, but I can bring you\r\nsome bits o’ plants from our cottage garden. Why does tha’ want ’em?”\r\n\r\nThen Mary told him about Basil and his brothers and sisters in India\r\nand of how she had hated them and of their calling her “Mistress Mary\r\nQuite Contrary.”\r\n\r\n“They used to dance round and sing at me. They sang—\r\n\r\n‘Mistress Mary, quite contrary,\r\n    How does your garden grow?\r\nWith silver bells, and cockle shells,\r\n    And marigolds all in a row.’\r\n\r\nI just remembered it and it made me wonder if there were really flowers\r\nlike silver bells.”\r\n\r\nShe frowned a little and gave her trowel a rather spiteful dig into the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n“I wasn’t as contrary as they were.”\r\n\r\nBut Dickon laughed.\r\n\r\n“Eh!” he said, and as he crumbled the rich black soil she saw he was\r\nsniffing up the scent of it. “There doesn’t seem to be no need for no\r\none to be contrary when there’s flowers an’ such like, an’ such lots o’\r\nfriendly wild things runnin’ about makin’ homes for themselves, or\r\nbuildin’ nests an’ singin’ an’ whistlin’, does there?”\r\n\r\nMary, kneeling by him holding the seeds, looked at him and stopped\r\nfrowning.\r\n\r\n“Dickon,” she said, “you are as nice as Martha said you were. I like\r\nyou, and you make the fifth person. I never thought I should like five\r\npeople.”\r\n\r\nDickon sat up on his heels as Martha did when she was polishing the\r\ngrate. He did look funny and delightful, Mary thought, with his round\r\nblue eyes and red cheeks and happy looking turned-up nose.\r\n\r\n“Only five folk as tha’ likes?” he said. “Who is th’ other four?”\r\n\r\n“Your mother and Martha,” Mary checked them off on her fingers, “and\r\nthe robin and Ben Weatherstaff.”\r\n\r\nDickon laughed so that he was obliged to stifle the sound by putting\r\nhis arm over his mouth.\r\n\r\n“I know tha’ thinks I’m a queer lad,” he said, “but I think tha’ art\r\nth’ queerest little lass I ever saw.”\r\n\r\nThen Mary did a strange thing. She leaned forward and asked him a\r\nquestion she had never dreamed of asking anyone before. And she tried\r\nto ask it in Yorkshire because that was his language, and in India a\r\nnative was always pleased if you knew his speech.\r\n\r\n“Does tha’ like me?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Eh!” he answered heartily, “that I does. I likes thee wonderful, an’\r\nso does th’ robin, I do believe!”\r\n\r\n“That’s two, then,” said Mary. “That’s two for me.”\r\n\r\nAnd then they began to work harder than ever and more joyfully. Mary\r\nwas startled and sorry when she heard the big clock in the courtyard\r\nstrike the hour of her midday dinner.\r\n\r\n“I shall have to go,” she said mournfully. “And you will have to go\r\ntoo, won’t you?”\r\n\r\nDickon grinned.\r\n\r\n“My dinner’s easy to carry about with me,” he said. “Mother always lets\r\nme put a bit o’ somethin’ in my pocket.”\r\n\r\nHe picked up his coat from the grass and brought out of a pocket a\r\nlumpy little bundle tied up in a quite clean, coarse, blue and white\r\nhandkerchief. It held two thick pieces of bread with a slice of\r\nsomething laid between them.\r\n\r\n“It’s oftenest naught but bread,” he said, “but I’ve got a fine slice\r\no’ fat bacon with it today.”\r\n\r\nMary thought it looked a queer dinner, but he seemed ready to enjoy it.\r\n\r\n“Run on an’ get thy victuals,” he said. “I’ll be done with mine first.\r\nI’ll get some more work done before I start back home.”\r\n\r\nHe sat down with his back against a tree.\r\n\r\n“I’ll call th’ robin up,” he said, “and give him th’ rind o’ th’ bacon\r\nto peck at. They likes a bit o’ fat wonderful.”\r\n\r\nMary could scarcely bear to leave him. Suddenly it seemed as if he\r\nmight be a sort of wood fairy who might be gone when she came into the\r\ngarden again. He seemed too good to be true. She went slowly half-way\r\nto the door in the wall and then she stopped and went back.\r\n\r\n“Whatever happens, you—you never would tell?” she said.\r\n\r\nHis poppy-colored cheeks were distended with his first big bite of\r\nbread and bacon, but he managed to smile encouragingly.\r\n\r\n“If tha’ was a missel thrush an’ showed me where thy nest was, does\r\ntha’ think I’d tell anyone? Not me,” he said. “Tha’ art as safe as a\r\nmissel thrush.”\r\n\r\nAnd she was quite sure she was.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n“MIGHT I HAVE A BIT OF EARTH?”\r\n\r\n\r\nMary ran so fast that she was rather out of breath when she reached her\r\nroom. Her hair was ruffled on her forehead and her cheeks were bright\r\npink. Her dinner was waiting on the table, and Martha was waiting near\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Tha’s a bit late,” she said. “Where has tha’ been?”\r\n\r\n“I’ve seen Dickon!” said Mary. “I’ve seen Dickon!”\r\n\r\n“I knew he’d come,” said Martha exultantly. “How does tha’ like him?”\r\n\r\n“I think—I think he’s beautiful!” said Mary in a determined voice.\r\n\r\nMartha looked rather taken aback but she looked pleased, too.\r\n\r\n“Well,” she said, “he’s th’ best lad as ever was born, but us never\r\nthought he was handsome. His nose turns up too much.”\r\n\r\n“I like it to turn up,” said Mary.\r\n\r\n“An’ his eyes is so round,” said Martha, a trifle doubtful. “Though\r\nthey’re a nice color.”\r\n\r\n“I like them round,” said Mary. “And they are exactly the color of the\r\nsky over the moor.”\r\n\r\nMartha beamed with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n“Mother says he made ’em that color with always lookin’ up at th’ birds\r\nan’ th’ clouds. But he has got a big mouth, hasn’t he, now?”\r\n\r\n“I love his big mouth,” said Mary obstinately. “I wish mine were just\r\nlike it.”\r\n\r\nMartha chuckled delightedly.\r\n\r\n“It’d look rare an’ funny in thy bit of a face,” she said. “But I\r\nknowed it would be that way when tha’ saw him. How did tha’ like th’\r\nseeds an’ th’ garden tools?”\r\n\r\n“How did you know he brought them?” asked Mary.\r\n\r\n“Eh! I never thought of him not bringin’ ’em. He’d be sure to bring ’em\r\nif they was in Yorkshire. He’s such a trusty lad.”\r\n\r\nMary was afraid that she might begin to ask difficult questions, but\r\nshe did not. She was very much interested in the seeds and gardening\r\ntools, and there was only one moment when Mary was frightened. This was\r\nwhen she began to ask where the flowers were to be planted.\r\n\r\n“Who did tha’ ask about it?” she inquired.\r\n\r\n“I haven’t asked anybody yet,” said Mary, hesitating.\r\n\r\n“Well, I wouldn’t ask th’ head gardener. He’s too grand, Mr. Roach is.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve never seen him,” said Mary. “I’ve only seen undergardeners and\r\nBen Weatherstaff.”\r\n\r\n“If I was you, I’d ask Ben Weatherstaff,” advised Martha. “He’s not\r\nhalf as bad as he looks, for all he’s so crabbed. Mr. Craven lets him\r\ndo what he likes because he was here when Mrs. Craven was alive, an’ he\r\nused to make her laugh. She liked him. Perhaps he’d find you a corner\r\nsomewhere out o’ the way.”\r\n\r\n“If it was out of the way and no one wanted it, no one _could_ mind my\r\nhaving it, could they?” Mary said anxiously.\r\n\r\n“There wouldn’t be no reason,” answered Martha. “You wouldn’t do no\r\nharm.”\r\n\r\nMary ate her dinner as quickly as she could and when she rose from the\r\ntable she was going to run to her room to put on her hat again, but\r\nMartha stopped her.\r\n\r\n“I’ve got somethin’ to tell you,” she said. “I thought I’d let you eat\r\nyour dinner first. Mr. Craven came back this mornin’ and I think he\r\nwants to see you.”\r\n\r\nMary turned quite pale.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” she said. “Why! Why! He didn’t want to see me when I came. I\r\nheard Pitcher say he didn’t.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” explained Martha, “Mrs. Medlock says it’s because o’ mother.\r\nShe was walkin’ to Thwaite village an’ she met him. She’d never spoke\r\nto him before, but Mrs. Craven had been to our cottage two or three\r\ntimes. He’d forgot, but mother hadn’t an’ she made bold to stop him. I\r\ndon’t know what she said to him about you but she said somethin’ as put\r\nhim in th’ mind to see you before he goes away again, tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” cried Mary, “is he going away tomorrow? I am so glad!”\r\n\r\n“He’s goin’ for a long time. He mayn’t come back till autumn or winter.\r\nHe’s goin’ to travel in foreign places. He’s always doin’ it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! I’m so glad—so glad!” said Mary thankfully.\r\n\r\nIf he did not come back until winter, or even autumn, there would be\r\ntime to watch the secret garden come alive. Even if he found out then\r\nand took it away from her she would have had that much at least.\r\n\r\n“When do you think he will want to see—”\r\n\r\nShe did not finish the sentence, because the door opened, and Mrs.\r\nMedlock walked in. She had on her best black dress and cap, and her\r\ncollar was fastened with a large brooch with a picture of a man’s face\r\non it. It was a colored photograph of Mr. Medlock who had died years\r\nago, and she always wore it when she was dressed up. She looked nervous\r\nand excited.\r\n\r\n“Your hair’s rough,” she said quickly. “Go and brush it. Martha, help\r\nher to slip on her best dress. Mr. Craven sent me to bring her to him\r\nin his study.”\r\n\r\nAll the pink left Mary’s cheeks. Her heart began to thump and she felt\r\nherself changing into a stiff, plain, silent child again. She did not\r\neven answer Mrs. Medlock, but turned and walked into her bedroom,\r\nfollowed by Martha. She said nothing while her dress was changed, and\r\nher hair brushed, and after she was quite tidy she followed Mrs.\r\nMedlock down the corridors, in silence. What was there for her to say?\r\nShe was obliged to go and see Mr. Craven and he would not like her, and\r\nshe would not like him. She knew what he would think of her.\r\n\r\nShe was taken to a part of the house she had not been into before. At\r\nlast Mrs. Medlock knocked at a door, and when someone said, “Come in,”\r\nthey entered the room together. A man was sitting in an armchair before\r\nthe fire, and Mrs. Medlock spoke to him.\r\n\r\n“This is Miss Mary, sir,” she said.\r\n\r\n“You can go and leave her here. I will ring for you when I want you to\r\ntake her away,” said Mr. Craven.\r\n\r\nWhen she went out and closed the door, Mary could only stand waiting, a\r\nplain little thing, twisting her thin hands together. She could see\r\nthat the man in the chair was not so much a hunchback as a man with\r\nhigh, rather crooked shoulders, and he had black hair streaked with\r\nwhite. He turned his head over his high shoulders and spoke to her.\r\n\r\n“Come here!” he said.\r\n\r\nMary went to him.\r\n\r\nHe was not ugly. His face would have been handsome if it had not been\r\nso miserable. He looked as if the sight of her worried and fretted him\r\nand as if he did not know what in the world to do with her.\r\n\r\n“Are you well?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Mary.\r\n\r\n“Do they take good care of you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\nHe rubbed his forehead fretfully as he looked her over.\r\n\r\n“You are very thin,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I am getting fatter,” Mary answered in what she knew was her stiffest\r\nway.\r\n\r\nWhat an unhappy face he had! His black eyes seemed as if they scarcely\r\nsaw her, as if they were seeing something else, and he could hardly\r\nkeep his thoughts upon her.\r\n\r\n“I forgot you,” he said. “How could I remember you? I intended to send\r\nyou a governess or a nurse, or someone of that sort, but I forgot.”\r\n\r\n“Please,” began Mary. “Please—” and then the lump in her throat choked\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“What do you want to say?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“I am—I am too big for a nurse,” said Mary. “And please—please don’t\r\nmake me have a governess yet.”\r\n\r\nHe rubbed his forehead again and stared at her.\r\n\r\n“That was what the Sowerby woman said,” he muttered absent-mindedly.\r\n\r\nThen Mary gathered a scrap of courage.\r\n\r\n“Is she—is she Martha’s mother?” she stammered.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think so,” he replied.\r\n\r\n“She knows about children,” said Mary. “She has twelve. She knows.”\r\n\r\nHe seemed to rouse himself.\r\n\r\n“What do you want to do?”\r\n\r\n“I want to play out of doors,” Mary answered, hoping that her voice did\r\nnot tremble. “I never liked it in India. It makes me hungry here, and I\r\nam getting fatter.”\r\n\r\nHe was watching her.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Sowerby said it would do you good. Perhaps it will,” he said.\r\n“She thought you had better get stronger before you had a governess.”\r\n\r\n“It makes me feel strong when I play and the wind comes over the moor,”\r\nargued Mary.\r\n\r\n“Where do you play?” he asked next.\r\n\r\n“Everywhere,” gasped Mary. “Martha’s mother sent me a skipping-rope. I\r\nskip and run—and I look about to see if things are beginning to stick\r\nup out of the earth. I don’t do any harm.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t look so frightened,” he said in a worried voice. “You could not\r\ndo any harm, a child like you! You may do what you like.”\r\n\r\nMary put her hand up to her throat because she was afraid he might see\r\nthe excited lump which she felt jump into it. She came a step nearer to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“May I?” she said tremulously.\r\n\r\nHer anxious little face seemed to worry him more than ever.\r\n\r\n“Don’t look so frightened,” he exclaimed. “Of course you may. I am your\r\nguardian, though I am a poor one for any child. I cannot give you time\r\nor attention. I am too ill, and wretched and distracted; but I wish you\r\nto be happy and comfortable. I don’t know anything about children, but\r\nMrs. Medlock is to see that you have all you need. I sent for you today\r\nbecause Mrs. Sowerby said I ought to see you. Her daughter had talked\r\nabout you. She thought you needed fresh air and freedom and running\r\nabout.”\r\n\r\n“She knows all about children,” Mary said again in spite of herself.\r\n\r\n“She ought to,” said Mr. Craven. “I thought her rather bold to stop me\r\non the moor, but she said—Mrs. Craven had been kind to her.” It seemed\r\nhard for him to speak his dead wife’s name. “She is a respectable\r\nwoman. Now I have seen you I think she said sensible things. Play out\r\nof doors as much as you like. It’s a big place and you may go where you\r\nlike and amuse yourself as you like. Is there anything you want?” as if\r\na sudden thought had struck him. “Do you want toys, books, dolls?”\r\n\r\n“Might I,” quavered Mary, “might I have a bit of earth?”\r\n\r\nIn her eagerness she did not realize how queer the words would sound\r\nand that they were not the ones she had meant to say. Mr. Craven looked\r\nquite startled.\r\n\r\n“Earth!” he repeated. “What do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“To plant seeds in—to make things grow—to see them come alive,” Mary\r\nfaltered.\r\n\r\nHe gazed at her a moment and then passed his hand quickly over his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“Do you—care about gardens so much,” he said slowly.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know about them in India,” said Mary. “I was always ill and\r\ntired and it was too hot. I sometimes made little beds in the sand and\r\nstuck flowers in them. But here it is different.”\r\n\r\nMr. Craven got up and began to walk slowly across the room.\r\n\r\n“A bit of earth,” he said to himself, and Mary thought that somehow she\r\nmust have reminded him of something. When he stopped and spoke to her\r\nhis dark eyes looked almost soft and kind.\r\n\r\n“You can have as much earth as you want,” he said. “You remind me of\r\nsomeone else who loved the earth and things that grow. When you see a\r\nbit of earth you want,” with something like a smile, “take it, child,\r\nand make it come alive.”\r\n\r\n“May I take it from anywhere—if it’s not wanted?”\r\n\r\n“Anywhere,” he answered. “There! You must go now, I am tired.” He\r\ntouched the bell to call Mrs. Medlock. “Good-by. I shall be away all\r\nsummer.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Medlock came so quickly that Mary thought she must have been\r\nwaiting in the corridor.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Medlock,” Mr. Craven said to her, “now I have seen the child I\r\nunderstand what Mrs. Sowerby meant. She must be less delicate before\r\nshe begins lessons. Give her simple, healthy food. Let her run wild in\r\nthe garden. Don’t look after her too much. She needs liberty and fresh\r\nair and romping about. Mrs. Sowerby is to come and see her now and then\r\nand she may sometimes go to the cottage.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Medlock looked pleased. She was relieved to hear that she need not\r\n“look after” Mary too much. She had felt her a tiresome charge and had\r\nindeed seen as little of her as she dared. In addition to this she was\r\nfond of Martha’s mother.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, sir,” she said. “Susan Sowerby and me went to school\r\ntogether and she’s as sensible and good-hearted a woman as you’d find\r\nin a day’s walk. I never had any children myself and she’s had twelve,\r\nand there never was healthier or better ones. Miss Mary can get no harm\r\nfrom them. I’d always take Susan Sowerby’s advice about children\r\nmyself. She’s what you might call healthy-minded—if you understand me.”\r\n\r\n“I understand,” Mr. Craven answered. “Take Miss Mary away now and send\r\nPitcher to me.”\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Medlock left her at the end of her own corridor Mary flew\r\nback to her room. She found Martha waiting there. Martha had, in fact,\r\nhurried back after she had removed the dinner service.\r\n\r\n“I can have my garden!” cried Mary. “I may have it where I like! I am\r\nnot going to have a governess for a long time! Your mother is coming to\r\nsee me and I may go to your cottage! He says a little girl like me\r\ncould not do any harm and I may do what I like—anywhere!”\r\n\r\n“Eh!” said Martha delightedly, “that was nice of him wasn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Martha,” said Mary solemnly, “he is really a nice man, only his face\r\nis so miserable and his forehead is all drawn together.”\r\n\r\nShe ran as quickly as she could to the garden. She had been away so\r\nmuch longer than she had thought she should and she knew Dickon would\r\nhave to set out early on his five-mile walk. When she slipped through\r\nthe door under the ivy, she saw he was not working where she had left\r\nhim. The gardening tools were laid together under a tree. She ran to\r\nthem, looking all round the place, but there was no Dickon to be seen.\r\nHe had gone away and the secret garden was empty—except for the robin\r\nwho had just flown across the wall and sat on a standard rose-bush\r\nwatching her.\r\n\r\n“He’s gone,” she said woefully. “Oh! was he—was he—was he only a wood\r\nfairy?”\r\n\r\nSomething white fastened to the standard rose-bush caught her eye. It\r\nwas a piece of paper, in fact, it was a piece of the letter she had\r\nprinted for Martha to send to Dickon. It was fastened on the bush with\r\na long thorn, and in a minute she knew Dickon had left it there. There\r\nwere some roughly printed letters on it and a sort of picture. At first\r\nshe could not tell what it was. Then she saw it was meant for a nest\r\nwith a bird sitting on it. Underneath were the printed letters and they\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n“I will cum bak.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n“I AM COLIN”\r\n\r\n\r\nMary took the picture back to the house when she went to her supper and\r\nshe showed it to Martha.\r\n\r\n“Eh!” said Martha with great pride. “I never knew our Dickon was as\r\nclever as that. That there’s a picture of a missel thrush on her nest,\r\nas large as life an’ twice as natural.”\r\n\r\nThen Mary knew Dickon had meant the picture to be a message. He had\r\nmeant that she might be sure he would keep her secret. Her garden was\r\nher nest and she was like a missel thrush. Oh, how she did like that\r\nqueer, common boy!\r\n\r\nShe hoped he would come back the very next day and she fell asleep\r\nlooking forward to the morning.\r\n\r\nBut you never know what the weather will do in Yorkshire, particularly\r\nin the springtime. She was awakened in the night by the sound of rain\r\nbeating with heavy drops against her window. It was pouring down in\r\ntorrents and the wind was “wuthering” round the corners and in the\r\nchimneys of the huge old house. Mary sat up in bed and felt miserable\r\nand angry.\r\n\r\n“The rain is as contrary as I ever was,” she said. “It came because it\r\nknew I did not want it.”\r\n\r\nShe threw herself back on her pillow and buried her face. She did not\r\ncry, but she lay and hated the sound of the heavily beating rain, she\r\nhated the wind and its “wuthering.” She could not go to sleep again.\r\nThe mournful sound kept her awake because she felt mournful herself. If\r\nshe had felt happy it would probably have lulled her to sleep. How it\r\n“wuthered” and how the big raindrops poured down and beat against the\r\npane!\r\n\r\n“It sounds just like a person lost on the moor and wandering on and on\r\ncrying,” she said.\r\n\r\nShe had been lying awake turning from side to side for about an hour,\r\nwhen suddenly something made her sit up in bed and turn her head toward\r\nthe door listening. She listened and she listened.\r\n\r\n“It isn’t the wind now,” she said in a loud whisper. “That isn’t the\r\nwind. It is different. It is that crying I heard before.”\r\n\r\nThe door of her room was ajar and the sound came down the corridor, a\r\nfar-off faint sound of fretful crying. She listened for a few minutes\r\nand each minute she became more and more sure. She felt as if she must\r\nfind out what it was. It seemed even stranger than the secret garden\r\nand the buried key. Perhaps the fact that she was in a rebellious mood\r\nmade her bold. She put her foot out of bed and stood on the floor.\r\n\r\n“I am going to find out what it is,” she said. “Everybody is in bed and\r\nI don’t care about Mrs. Medlock—I don’t care!”\r\n\r\nThere was a candle by her bedside and she took it up and went softly\r\nout of the room. The corridor looked very long and dark, but she was\r\ntoo excited to mind that. She thought she remembered the corners she\r\nmust turn to find the short corridor with the door covered with\r\ntapestry—the one Mrs. Medlock had come through the day she lost\r\nherself. The sound had come up that passage. So she went on with her\r\ndim light, almost feeling her way, her heart beating so loud that she\r\nfancied she could hear it. The far-off faint crying went on and led\r\nher. Sometimes it stopped for a moment or so and then began again. Was\r\nthis the right corner to turn? She stopped and thought. Yes it was.\r\nDown this passage and then to the left, and then up two broad steps,\r\nand then to the right again. Yes, there was the tapestry door.\r\n\r\nShe pushed it open very gently and closed it behind her, and she stood\r\nin the corridor and could hear the crying quite plainly, though it was\r\nnot loud. It was on the other side of the wall at her left and a few\r\nyards farther on there was a door. She could see a glimmer of light\r\ncoming from beneath it. The Someone was crying in that room, and it was\r\nquite a young Someone.\r\n\r\nSo she walked to the door and pushed it open, and there she was\r\nstanding in the room!\r\n\r\nIt was a big room with ancient, handsome furniture in it. There was a\r\nlow fire glowing faintly on the hearth and a night light burning by the\r\nside of a carved four-posted bed hung with brocade, and on the bed was\r\nlying a boy, crying fretfully.\r\n\r\nMary wondered if she was in a real place or if she had fallen asleep\r\nagain and was dreaming without knowing it.\r\n\r\nThe boy had a sharp, delicate face the color of ivory and he seemed to\r\nhave eyes too big for it. He had also a lot of hair which tumbled over\r\nhis forehead in heavy locks and made his thin face seem smaller. He\r\nlooked like a boy who had been ill, but he was crying more as if he\r\nwere tired and cross than as if he were in pain.\r\n\r\nMary stood near the door with her candle in her hand, holding her\r\nbreath. Then she crept across the room, and, as she drew nearer, the\r\nlight attracted the boy’s attention and he turned his head on his\r\npillow and stared at her, his gray eyes opening so wide that they\r\nseemed immense.\r\n\r\n“Who are you?” he said at last in a half-frightened whisper. “Are you a\r\nghost?”\r\n\r\n“No, I am not,” Mary answered, her own whisper sounding half\r\nfrightened. “Are you one?”\r\n\r\nHe stared and stared and stared. Mary could not help noticing what\r\nstrange eyes he had. They were agate gray and they looked too big for\r\nhis face because they had black lashes all round them.\r\n\r\n“No,” he replied after waiting a moment or so. “I am Colin.”\r\n\r\n“Who is Colin?” she faltered.\r\n\r\n“I am Colin Craven. Who are you?”\r\n\r\n“I am Mary Lennox. Mr. Craven is my uncle.”\r\n\r\n“He is my father,” said the boy.\r\n\r\n“Your father!” gasped Mary. “No one ever told me he had a boy! Why\r\ndidn’t they?”\r\n\r\n“Come here,” he said, still keeping his strange eyes fixed on her with\r\nan anxious expression.\r\n\r\nShe came close to the bed and he put out his hand and touched her.\r\n\r\n“You are real, aren’t you?” he said. “I have such real dreams very\r\noften. You might be one of them.”\r\n\r\nMary had slipped on a woolen wrapper before she left her room and she\r\nput a piece of it between his fingers.\r\n\r\n“Rub that and see how thick and warm it is,” she said. “I will pinch\r\nyou a little if you like, to show you how real I am. For a minute I\r\nthought you might be a dream too.”\r\n\r\n“Where did you come from?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“From my own room. The wind wuthered so I couldn’t go to sleep and I\r\nheard someone crying and wanted to find out who it was. What were you\r\ncrying for?”\r\n\r\n“Because I couldn’t go to sleep either and my head ached. Tell me your\r\nname again.”\r\n\r\n“Mary Lennox. Did no one ever tell you I had come to live here?”\r\n\r\nHe was still fingering the fold of her wrapper, but he began to look a\r\nlittle more as if he believed in her reality.\r\n\r\n“No,” he answered. “They daren’t.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked Mary.\r\n\r\n“Because I should have been afraid you would see me. I won’t let people\r\nsee me and talk me over.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” Mary asked again, feeling more mystified every moment.\r\n\r\n“Because I am like this always, ill and having to lie down. My father\r\nwon’t let people talk me over either. The servants are not allowed to\r\nspeak about me. If I live I may be a hunchback, but I shan’t live. My\r\nfather hates to think I may be like him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, what a queer house this is!” Mary said. “What a queer house!\r\nEverything is a kind of secret. Rooms are locked up and gardens are\r\nlocked up—and you! Have you been locked up?”\r\n\r\n“No. I stay in this room because I don’t want to be moved out of it. It\r\ntires me too much.”\r\n\r\n“Does your father come and see you?” Mary ventured.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes. Generally when I am asleep. He doesn’t want to see me.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” Mary could not help asking again.\r\n\r\nA sort of angry shadow passed over the boy’s face.\r\n\r\n“My mother died when I was born and it makes him wretched to look at\r\nme. He thinks I don’t know, but I’ve heard people talking. He almost\r\nhates me.”\r\n\r\n“He hates the garden, because she died,” said Mary half speaking to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n“What garden?” the boy asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh! just—just a garden she used to like,” Mary stammered. “Have you\r\nbeen here always?”\r\n\r\n“Nearly always. Sometimes I have been taken to places at the seaside,\r\nbut I won’t stay because people stare at me. I used to wear an iron\r\nthing to keep my back straight, but a grand doctor came from London to\r\nsee me and said it was stupid. He told them to take it off and keep me\r\nout in the fresh air. I hate fresh air and I don’t want to go out.”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t when first I came here,” said Mary. “Why do you keep looking\r\nat me like that?”\r\n\r\n“Because of the dreams that are so real,” he answered rather fretfully.\r\n“Sometimes when I open my eyes I don’t believe I’m awake.”\r\n\r\n“We’re both awake,” said Mary. She glanced round the room with its high\r\nceiling and shadowy corners and dim fire-light. “It looks quite like a\r\ndream, and it’s the middle of the night, and everybody in the house is\r\nasleep—everybody but us. We are wide awake.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want it to be a dream,” the boy said restlessly.\r\n\r\nMary thought of something all at once.\r\n\r\n“If you don’t like people to see you,” she began, “do you want me to go\r\naway?”\r\n\r\nHe still held the fold of her wrapper and he gave it a little pull.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said. “I should be sure you were a dream if you went. If you\r\nare real, sit down on that big footstool and talk. I want to hear about\r\nyou.”\r\n\r\nMary put down her candle on the table near the bed and sat down on the\r\ncushioned stool. She did not want to go away at all. She wanted to stay\r\nin the mysterious hidden-away room and talk to the mysterious boy.\r\n\r\n“What do you want me to tell you?” she said.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to know how long she had been at Misselthwaite; he wanted to\r\nknow which corridor her room was on; he wanted to know what she had\r\nbeen doing; if she disliked the moor as he disliked it; where she had\r\nlived before she came to Yorkshire. She answered all these questions\r\nand many more and he lay back on his pillow and listened. He made her\r\ntell him a great deal about India and about her voyage across the\r\nocean. She found out that because he had been an invalid he had not\r\nlearned things as other children had. One of his nurses had taught him\r\nto read when he was quite little and he was always reading and looking\r\nat pictures in splendid books.\r\n\r\nThough his father rarely saw him when he was awake, he was given all\r\nsorts of wonderful things to amuse himself with. He never seemed to\r\nhave been amused, however. He could have anything he asked for and was\r\nnever made to do anything he did not like to do.\r\n\r\n“Everyone is obliged to do what pleases me,” he said indifferently. “It\r\nmakes me ill to be angry. No one believes I shall live to grow up.”\r\n\r\nHe said it as if he was so accustomed to the idea that it had ceased to\r\nmatter to him at all. He seemed to like the sound of Mary’s voice. As\r\nshe went on talking he listened in a drowsy, interested way. Once or\r\ntwice she wondered if he were not gradually falling into a doze. But at\r\nlast he asked a question which opened up a new subject.\r\n\r\n“How old are you?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I am ten,” answered Mary, forgetting herself for the moment, “and so\r\nare you.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know that?” he demanded in a surprised voice.\r\n\r\n“Because when you were born the garden door was locked and the key was\r\nburied. And it has been locked for ten years.”\r\n\r\nColin half sat up, turning toward her, leaning on his elbows.\r\n\r\n“What garden door was locked? Who did it? Where was the key buried?” he\r\nexclaimed as if he were suddenly very much interested.\r\n\r\n“It—it was the garden Mr. Craven hates,” said Mary nervously. “He\r\nlocked the door. No one—no one knew where he buried the key.”\r\n\r\n“What sort of a garden is it?” Colin persisted eagerly.\r\n\r\n“No one has been allowed to go into it for ten years,” was Mary’s\r\ncareful answer.\r\n\r\nBut it was too late to be careful. He was too much like herself. He too\r\nhad had nothing to think about and the idea of a hidden garden\r\nattracted him as it had attracted her. He asked question after\r\nquestion. Where was it? Had she never looked for the door? Had she\r\nnever asked the gardeners?\r\n\r\n“They won’t talk about it,” said Mary. “I think they have been told not\r\nto answer questions.”\r\n\r\n“I would make them,” said Colin.\r\n\r\n“Could you?” Mary faltered, beginning to feel frightened. If he could\r\nmake people answer questions, who knew what might happen!\r\n\r\n“Everyone is obliged to please me. I told you that,” he said. “If I\r\nwere to live, this place would sometime belong to me. They all know\r\nthat. I would make them tell me.”\r\n\r\nMary had not known that she herself had been spoiled, but she could see\r\nquite plainly that this mysterious boy had been. He thought that the\r\nwhole world belonged to him. How peculiar he was and how coolly he\r\nspoke of not living.\r\n\r\n“Do you think you won’t live?” she asked, partly because she was\r\ncurious and partly in hope of making him forget the garden.\r\n\r\n“I don’t suppose I shall,” he answered as indifferently as he had\r\nspoken before. “Ever since I remember anything I have heard people say\r\nI shan’t. At first they thought I was too little to understand and now\r\nthey think I don’t hear. But I do. My doctor is my father’s cousin. He\r\nis quite poor and if I die he will have all Misselthwaite when my\r\nfather is dead. I should think he wouldn’t want me to live.”\r\n\r\n“Do you want to live?” inquired Mary.\r\n\r\n“No,” he answered, in a cross, tired fashion. “But I don’t want to die.\r\nWhen I feel ill I lie here and think about it until I cry and cry.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard you crying three times,” Mary said, “but I did not know\r\nwho it was. Were you crying about that?” She did so want him to forget\r\nthe garden.\r\n\r\n“I dare say,” he answered. “Let us talk about something else. Talk\r\nabout that garden. Don’t you want to see it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Mary, in quite a low voice.\r\n\r\n“I do,” he went on persistently. “I don’t think I ever really wanted to\r\nsee anything before, but I want to see that garden. I want the key dug\r\nup. I want the door unlocked. I would let them take me there in my\r\nchair. That would be getting fresh air. I am going to make them open\r\nthe door.”\r\n\r\nHe had become quite excited and his strange eyes began to shine like\r\nstars and looked more immense than ever.\r\n\r\n“They have to please me,” he said. “I will make them take me there and\r\nI will let you go, too.”\r\n\r\nMary’s hands clutched each other. Everything would be\r\nspoiled—everything! Dickon would never come back. She would never again\r\nfeel like a missel thrush with a safe-hidden nest.\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t—don’t—don’t—don’t do that!” she cried out.\r\n\r\nHe stared as if he thought she had gone crazy!\r\n\r\n“Why?” he exclaimed. “You said you wanted to see it.”\r\n\r\n“I do,” she answered almost with a sob in her throat, “but if you make\r\nthem open the door and take you in like that it will never be a secret\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nHe leaned still farther forward.\r\n\r\n“A secret,” he said. “What do you mean? Tell me.”\r\n\r\nMary’s words almost tumbled over one another.\r\n\r\n“You see—you see,” she panted, “if no one knows but ourselves—if there\r\nwas a door, hidden somewhere under the ivy—if there was—and we could\r\nfind it; and if we could slip through it together and shut it behind\r\nus, and no one knew anyone was inside and we called it our garden and\r\npretended that—that we were missel thrushes and it was our nest, and if\r\nwe played there almost every day and dug and planted seeds and made it\r\nall come alive—”\r\n\r\n“Is it dead?” he interrupted her.\r\n\r\n“It soon will be if no one cares for it,” she went on. “The bulbs will\r\nlive but the roses—”\r\n\r\nHe stopped her again as excited as she was herself.\r\n\r\n“What are bulbs?” he put in quickly.\r\n\r\n“They are daffodils and lilies and snowdrops. They are working in the\r\nearth now—pushing up pale green points because the spring is coming.”\r\n\r\n“Is the spring coming?” he said. “What is it like? You don’t see it in\r\nrooms if you are ill.”\r\n\r\n“It is the sun shining on the rain and the rain falling on the\r\nsunshine, and things pushing up and working under the earth,” said\r\nMary. “If the garden was a secret and we could get into it we could\r\nwatch the things grow bigger every day, and see how many roses are\r\nalive. Don’t you see? Oh, don’t you see how much nicer it would be if\r\nit was a secret?”\r\n\r\nHe dropped back on his pillow and lay there with an odd expression on\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n“I never had a secret,” he said, “except that one about not living to\r\ngrow up. They don’t know I know that, so it is a sort of secret. But I\r\nlike this kind better.”\r\n\r\n“If you won’t make them take you to the garden,” pleaded Mary,\r\n“perhaps—I feel almost sure I can find out how to get in sometime. And\r\nthen—if the doctor wants you to go out in your chair, and if you can\r\nalways do what you want to do, perhaps—perhaps we might find some boy\r\nwho would push you, and we could go alone and it would always be a\r\nsecret garden.”\r\n\r\n“I should—like—that,” he said very slowly, his eyes looking dreamy. “I\r\nshould like that. I should not mind fresh air in a secret garden.”\r\n\r\nMary began to recover her breath and feel safer because the idea of\r\nkeeping the secret seemed to please him. She felt almost sure that if\r\nshe kept on talking and could make him see the garden in his mind as\r\nshe had seen it he would like it so much that he could not bear to\r\nthink that everybody might tramp in to it when they chose.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what I _think_ it would be like, if we could go into\r\nit,” she said. “It has been shut up so long things have grown into a\r\ntangle perhaps.”\r\n\r\nHe lay quite still and listened while she went on talking about the\r\nroses which _might_ have clambered from tree to tree and hung\r\ndown—about the many birds which _might_ have built their nests there\r\nbecause it was so safe. And then she told him about the robin and Ben\r\nWeatherstaff, and there was so much to tell about the robin and it was\r\nso easy and safe to talk about it that she ceased to be afraid. The\r\nrobin pleased him so much that he smiled until he looked almost\r\nbeautiful, and at first Mary had thought that he was even plainer than\r\nherself, with his big eyes and heavy locks of hair.\r\n\r\n“I did not know birds could be like that,” he said. “But if you stay in\r\na room you never see things. What a lot of things you know. I feel as\r\nif you had been inside that garden.”\r\n\r\nShe did not know what to say, so she did not say anything. He evidently\r\ndid not expect an answer and the next moment he gave her a surprise.\r\n\r\n“I am going to let you look at something,” he said. “Do you see that\r\nrose-colored silk curtain hanging on the wall over the mantel-piece?”\r\n\r\nMary had not noticed it before, but she looked up and saw it. It was a\r\ncurtain of soft silk hanging over what seemed to be some picture.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“There is a cord hanging from it,” said Colin. “Go and pull it.”\r\n\r\nMary got up, much mystified, and found the cord. When she pulled it the\r\nsilk curtain ran back on rings and when it ran back it uncovered a\r\npicture. It was the picture of a girl with a laughing face. She had\r\nbright hair tied up with a blue ribbon and her gay, lovely eyes were\r\nexactly like Colin’s unhappy ones, agate gray and looking twice as big\r\nas they really were because of the black lashes all round them.\r\n\r\n“She is my mother,” said Colin complainingly. “I don’t see why she\r\ndied. Sometimes I hate her for doing it.”\r\n\r\n“How queer!” said Mary.\r\n\r\n“If she had lived I believe I should not have been ill always,” he\r\ngrumbled. “I dare say I should have lived, too. And my father would not\r\nhave hated to look at me. I dare say I should have had a strong back.\r\nDraw the curtain again.”\r\n\r\nMary did as she was told and returned to her footstool.\r\n\r\n“She is much prettier than you,” she said, “but her eyes are just like\r\nyours—at least they are the same shape and color. Why is the curtain\r\ndrawn over her?”\r\n\r\nHe moved uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n“I made them do it,” he said. “Sometimes I don’t like to see her\r\nlooking at me. She smiles too much when I am ill and miserable.\r\nBesides, she is mine and I don’t want everyone to see her.”\r\n\r\nThere were a few moments of silence and then Mary spoke.\r\n\r\n“What would Mrs. Medlock do if she found out that I had been here?” she\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n“She would do as I told her to do,” he answered. “And I should tell her\r\nthat I wanted you to come here and talk to me every day. I am glad you\r\ncame.”\r\n\r\n“So am I,” said Mary. “I will come as often as I can, but”—she\r\nhesitated—“I shall have to look every day for the garden door.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, you must,” said Colin, “and you can tell me about it afterward.”\r\n\r\nHe lay thinking a few minutes, as he had done before, and then he spoke\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“I think you shall be a secret, too,” he said. “I will not tell them\r\nuntil they find out. I can always send the nurse out of the room and\r\nsay that I want to be by myself. Do you know Martha?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know her very well,” said Mary. “She waits on me.”\r\n\r\nHe nodded his head toward the outer corridor.\r\n\r\n“She is the one who is asleep in the other room. The nurse went away\r\nyesterday to stay all night with her sister and she always makes Martha\r\nattend to me when she wants to go out. Martha shall tell you when to\r\ncome here.”\r\n\r\nThen Mary understood Martha’s troubled look when she had asked\r\nquestions about the crying.\r\n\r\n“Martha knew about you all the time?” she said.\r\n\r\n“Yes; she often attends to me. The nurse likes to get away from me and\r\nthen Martha comes.”\r\n\r\n“I have been here a long time,” said Mary. “Shall I go away now? Your\r\neyes look sleepy.”\r\n\r\n“I wish I could go to sleep before you leave me,” he said rather shyly.\r\n\r\n“Shut your eyes,” said Mary, drawing her footstool closer, “and I will\r\ndo what my Ayah used to do in India. I will pat your hand and stroke it\r\nand sing something quite low.”\r\n\r\n“I should like that perhaps,” he said drowsily.\r\n\r\nSomehow she was sorry for him and did not want him to lie awake, so she\r\nleaned against the bed and began to stroke and pat his hand and sing a\r\nvery low little chanting song in Hindustani.\r\n\r\n“That is nice,” he said more drowsily still, and she went on chanting\r\nand stroking, but when she looked at him again his black lashes were\r\nlying close against his cheeks, for his eyes were shut and he was fast\r\nasleep. So she got up softly, took her candle and crept away without\r\nmaking a sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\nA YOUNG RAJAH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moor was hidden in mist when the morning came, and the rain had not\r\nstopped pouring down. There could be no going out of doors. Martha was\r\nso busy that Mary had no opportunity of talking to her, but in the\r\nafternoon she asked her to come and sit with her in the nursery. She\r\ncame bringing the stocking she was always knitting when she was doing\r\nnothing else.\r\n\r\n“What’s the matter with thee?” she asked as soon as they sat down.\r\n“Tha’ looks as if tha’d somethin’ to say.”\r\n\r\n“I have. I have found out what the crying was,” said Mary.\r\n\r\nMartha let her knitting drop on her knee and gazed at her with startled\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“Tha’ hasn’t!” she exclaimed. “Never!”\r\n\r\n“I heard it in the night,” Mary went on. “And I got up and went to see\r\nwhere it came from. It was Colin. I found him.”\r\n\r\nMartha’s face became red with fright.\r\n\r\n“Eh! Miss Mary!” she said half crying. “Tha’ shouldn’t have done\r\nit—tha’ shouldn’t! Tha’ll get me in trouble. I never told thee nothin’\r\nabout him—but tha’ll get me in trouble. I shall lose my place and\r\nwhat’ll mother do!”\r\n\r\n“You won’t lose your place,” said Mary. “He was glad I came. We talked\r\nand talked and he said he was glad I came.”\r\n\r\n“Was he?” cried Martha. “Art tha’ sure? Tha’ doesn’t know what he’s\r\nlike when anything vexes him. He’s a big lad to cry like a baby, but\r\nwhen he’s in a passion he’ll fair scream just to frighten us. He knows\r\nus daren’t call our souls our own.”\r\n\r\n“He wasn’t vexed,” said Mary. “I asked him if I should go away and he\r\nmade me stay. He asked me questions and I sat on a big footstool and\r\ntalked to him about India and about the robin and gardens. He wouldn’t\r\nlet me go. He let me see his mother’s picture. Before I left him I sang\r\nhim to sleep.”\r\n\r\nMartha fairly gasped with amazement.\r\n\r\n“I can scarcely believe thee!” she protested. “It’s as if tha’d walked\r\nstraight into a lion’s den. If he’d been like he is most times he’d\r\nhave throwed himself into one of his tantrums and roused th’ house. He\r\nwon’t let strangers look at him.”\r\n\r\n“He let me look at him. I looked at him all the time and he looked at\r\nme. We stared!” said Mary.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what to do!” cried agitated Martha. “If Mrs. Medlock\r\nfinds out, she’ll think I broke orders and told thee and I shall be\r\npacked back to mother.”\r\n\r\n“He is not going to tell Mrs. Medlock anything about it yet. It’s to be\r\na sort of secret just at first,” said Mary firmly. “And he says\r\neverybody is obliged to do as he pleases.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, that’s true enough—th’ bad lad!” sighed Martha, wiping her\r\nforehead with her apron.\r\n\r\n“He says Mrs. Medlock must. And he wants me to come and talk to him\r\nevery day. And you are to tell me when he wants me.”\r\n\r\n“Me!” said Martha; “I shall lose my place—I shall for sure!”\r\n\r\n“You can’t if you are doing what he wants you to do and everybody is\r\nordered to obey him,” Mary argued.\r\n\r\n“Does tha’ mean to say,” cried Martha with wide open eyes, “that he was\r\nnice to thee!”\r\n\r\n“I think he almost liked me,” Mary answered.\r\n\r\n“Then tha’ must have bewitched him!” decided Martha, drawing a long\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n“Do you mean Magic?” inquired Mary. “I’ve heard about Magic in India,\r\nbut I can’t make it. I just went into his room and I was so surprised\r\nto see him I stood and stared. And then he turned round and stared at\r\nme. And he thought I was a ghost or a dream and I thought perhaps he\r\nwas. And it was so queer being there alone together in the middle of\r\nthe night and not knowing about each other. And we began to ask each\r\nother questions. And when I asked him if I must go away he said I must\r\nnot.”\r\n\r\n“Th’ world’s comin’ to a end!” gasped Martha.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter with him?” asked Mary.\r\n\r\n“Nobody knows for sure and certain,” said Martha. “Mr. Craven went off\r\nhis head like when he was born. Th’ doctors thought he’d have to be put\r\nin a ’sylum. It was because Mrs. Craven died like I told you. He\r\nwouldn’t set eyes on th’ baby. He just raved and said it’d be another\r\nhunchback like him and it’d better die.”\r\n\r\n“Is Colin a hunchback?” Mary asked. “He didn’t look like one.”\r\n\r\n“He isn’t yet,” said Martha. “But he began all wrong. Mother said that\r\nthere was enough trouble and raging in th’ house to set any child\r\nwrong. They was afraid his back was weak an’ they’ve always been takin’\r\ncare of it—keepin’ him lyin’ down and not lettin’ him walk. Once they\r\nmade him wear a brace but he fretted so he was downright ill. Then a\r\nbig doctor came to see him an’ made them take it off. He talked to th’\r\nother doctor quite rough—in a polite way. He said there’d been too much\r\nmedicine and too much lettin’ him have his own way.”\r\n\r\n“I think he’s a very spoiled boy,” said Mary.\r\n\r\n“He’s th’ worst young nowt as ever was!” said Martha. “I won’t say as\r\nhe hasn’t been ill a good bit. He’s had coughs an’ colds that’s nearly\r\nkilled him two or three times. Once he had rheumatic fever an’ once he\r\nhad typhoid. Eh! Mrs. Medlock did get a fright then. He’d been out of\r\nhis head an’ she was talkin’ to th’ nurse, thinkin’ he didn’t know\r\nnothin’, an’ she said, ‘He’ll die this time sure enough, an’ best thing\r\nfor him an’ for everybody.’ An’ she looked at him an’ there he was with\r\nhis big eyes open, starin’ at her as sensible as she was herself. She\r\ndidn’t know wha’d happen but he just stared at her an’ says, ‘You give\r\nme some water an’ stop talkin’.’”\r\n\r\n“Do you think he will die?” asked Mary.\r\n\r\n“Mother says there’s no reason why any child should live that gets no\r\nfresh air an’ doesn’t do nothin’ but lie on his back an’ read\r\npicture-books an’ take medicine. He’s weak and hates th’ trouble o’\r\nbein’ taken out o’ doors, an’ he gets cold so easy he says it makes him\r\nill.”\r\n\r\nMary sat and looked at the fire.\r\n\r\n“I wonder,” she said slowly, “if it would not do him good to go out\r\ninto a garden and watch things growing. It did me good.”\r\n\r\n“One of th’ worst fits he ever had,” said Martha, “was one time they\r\ntook him out where the roses is by the fountain. He’d been readin’ in a\r\npaper about people gettin’ somethin’ he called ‘rose cold’ an’ he began\r\nto sneeze an’ said he’d got it an’ then a new gardener as didn’t know\r\nth’ rules passed by an’ looked at him curious. He threw himself into a\r\npassion an’ he said he’d looked at him because he was going to be a\r\nhunchback. He cried himself into a fever an’ was ill all night.”\r\n\r\n“If he ever gets angry at me, I’ll never go and see him again,” said\r\nMary.\r\n\r\n“He’ll have thee if he wants thee,” said Martha. “Tha’ may as well know\r\nthat at th’ start.”\r\n\r\nVery soon afterward a bell rang and she rolled up her knitting.\r\n\r\n“I dare say th’ nurse wants me to stay with him a bit,” she said. “I\r\nhope he’s in a good temper.”\r\n\r\nShe was out of the room about ten minutes and then she came back with a\r\npuzzled expression.\r\n\r\n“Well, tha’ has bewitched him,” she said. “He’s up on his sofa with his\r\npicture-books. He’s told the nurse to stay away until six o’clock. I’m\r\nto wait in the next room. Th’ minute she was gone he called me to him\r\nan’ says, ‘I want Mary Lennox to come and talk to me, and remember\r\nyou’re not to tell anyone.’ You’d better go as quick as you can.”\r\n\r\nMary was quite willing to go quickly. She did not want to see Colin as\r\nmuch as she wanted to see Dickon; but she wanted to see him very much.\r\n\r\nThere was a bright fire on the hearth when she entered his room, and in\r\nthe daylight she saw it was a very beautiful room indeed. There were\r\nrich colors in the rugs and hangings and pictures and books on the\r\nwalls which made it look glowing and comfortable even in spite of the\r\ngray sky and falling rain. Colin looked rather like a picture himself.\r\nHe was wrapped in a velvet dressing-gown and sat against a big brocaded\r\ncushion. He had a red spot on each cheek.\r\n\r\n“Come in,” he said. “I’ve been thinking about you all morning.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been thinking about you, too,” answered Mary. “You don’t know how\r\nfrightened Martha is. She says Mrs. Medlock will think she told me\r\nabout you and then she will be sent away.”\r\n\r\nHe frowned.\r\n\r\n“Go and tell her to come here,” he said. “She is in the next room.”\r\n\r\nMary went and brought her back. Poor Martha was shaking in her shoes.\r\nColin was still frowning.\r\n\r\n“Have you to do what I please or have you not?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“I have to do what you please, sir,” Martha faltered, turning quite\r\nred.\r\n\r\n“Has Medlock to do what I please?”\r\n\r\n“Everybody has, sir,” said Martha.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, if I order you to bring Miss Mary to me, how can Medlock\r\nsend you away if she finds it out?”\r\n\r\n“Please don’t let her, sir,” pleaded Martha.\r\n\r\n“I’ll send _her_ away if she dares to say a word about such a thing,”\r\nsaid Master Craven grandly. “She wouldn’t like that, I can tell you.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, sir,” bobbing a curtsy, “I want to do my duty, sir.”\r\n\r\n“What I want is your duty” said Colin more grandly still. “I’ll take\r\ncare of you. Now go away.”\r\n\r\nWhen the door closed behind Martha, Colin found Mistress Mary gazing at\r\nhim as if he had set her wondering.\r\n\r\n“Why do you look at me like that?” he asked her. “What are you thinking\r\nabout?”\r\n\r\n“I am thinking about two things.”\r\n\r\n“What are they? Sit down and tell me.”\r\n\r\n“This is the first one,” said Mary, seating herself on the big stool.\r\n“Once in India I saw a boy who was a Rajah. He had rubies and emeralds\r\nand diamonds stuck all over him. He spoke to his people just as you\r\nspoke to Martha. Everybody had to do everything he told them—in a\r\nminute. I think they would have been killed if they hadn’t.”\r\n\r\n“I shall make you tell me about Rajahs presently,” he said, “but first\r\ntell me what the second thing was.”\r\n\r\n“I was thinking,” said Mary, “how different you are from Dickon.”\r\n\r\n“Who is Dickon?” he said. “What a queer name!”\r\n\r\nShe might as well tell him, she thought she could talk about Dickon\r\nwithout mentioning the secret garden. She had liked to hear Martha talk\r\nabout him. Besides, she longed to talk about him. It would seem to\r\nbring him nearer.\r\n\r\n“He is Martha’s brother. He is twelve years old,” she explained. “He is\r\nnot like anyone else in the world. He can charm foxes and squirrels and\r\nbirds just as the natives in India charm snakes. He plays a very soft\r\ntune on a pipe and they come and listen.”\r\n\r\nThere were some big books on a table at his side and he dragged one\r\nsuddenly toward him.\r\n\r\n“There is a picture of a snake-charmer in this,” he exclaimed. “Come\r\nand look at it.”\r\n\r\nThe book was a beautiful one with superb colored illustrations and he\r\nturned to one of them.\r\n\r\n“Can he do that?” he asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n“He played on his pipe and they listened,” Mary explained. “But he\r\ndoesn’t call it Magic. He says it’s because he lives on the moor so\r\nmuch and he knows their ways. He says he feels sometimes as if he was a\r\nbird or a rabbit himself, he likes them so. I think he asked the robin\r\nquestions. It seemed as if they talked to each other in soft chirps.”\r\n\r\nColin lay back on his cushion and his eyes grew larger and larger and\r\nthe spots on his cheeks burned.\r\n\r\n“Tell me some more about him,” he said.\r\n\r\n“He knows all about eggs and nests,” Mary went on. “And he knows where\r\nfoxes and badgers and otters live. He keeps them secret so that other\r\nboys won’t find their holes and frighten them. He knows about\r\neverything that grows or lives on the moor.”\r\n\r\n“Does he like the moor?” said Colin. “How can he when it’s such a\r\ngreat, bare, dreary place?”\r\n\r\n“It’s the most beautiful place,” protested Mary. “Thousands of lovely\r\nthings grow on it and there are thousands of little creatures all busy\r\nbuilding nests and making holes and burrows and chippering or singing\r\nor squeaking to each other. They are so busy and having such fun under\r\nthe earth or in the trees or heather. It’s their world.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know all that?” said Colin, turning on his elbow to look at\r\nher.\r\n\r\n“I have never been there once, really,” said Mary suddenly remembering.\r\n“I only drove over it in the dark. I thought it was hideous. Martha\r\ntold me about it first and then Dickon. When Dickon talks about it you\r\nfeel as if you saw things and heard them and as if you were standing in\r\nthe heather with the sun shining and the gorse smelling like honey—and\r\nall full of bees and butterflies.”\r\n\r\n“You never see anything if you are ill,” said Colin restlessly. He\r\nlooked like a person listening to a new sound in the distance and\r\nwondering what it was.\r\n\r\n“You can’t if you stay in a room,” said Mary.\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t go on the moor,” he said in a resentful tone.\r\n\r\nMary was silent for a minute and then she said something bold.\r\n\r\n“You might—sometime.”\r\n\r\nHe moved as if he were startled.\r\n\r\n“Go on the moor! How could I? I am going to die.”\r\n\r\n“How do you know?” said Mary unsympathetically. She didn’t like the way\r\nhe had of talking about dying. She did not feel very sympathetic. She\r\nfelt rather as if he almost boasted about it.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I’ve heard it ever since I remember,” he answered crossly. “They\r\nare always whispering about it and thinking I don’t notice. They wish I\r\nwould, too.”\r\n\r\nMistress Mary felt quite contrary. She pinched her lips together.\r\n\r\n“If they wished I would,” she said, “I wouldn’t. Who wishes you would?”\r\n\r\n“The servants—and of course Dr. Craven because he would get\r\nMisselthwaite and be rich instead of poor. He daren’t say so, but he\r\nalways looks cheerful when I am worse. When I had typhoid fever his\r\nface got quite fat. I think my father wishes it, too.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe he does,” said Mary quite obstinately.\r\n\r\nThat made Colin turn and look at her again.\r\n\r\n“Don’t you?” he said.\r\n\r\nAnd then he lay back on his cushion and was still, as if he were\r\nthinking. And there was quite a long silence. Perhaps they were both of\r\nthem thinking strange things children do not usually think of.\r\n\r\n“I like the grand doctor from London, because he made them take the\r\niron thing off,” said Mary at last “Did he say you were going to die?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“What did he say?”\r\n\r\n“He didn’t whisper,” Colin answered. “Perhaps he knew I hated\r\nwhispering. I heard him say one thing quite aloud. He said, ‘The lad\r\nmight live if he would make up his mind to it. Put him in the humor.’\r\nIt sounded as if he was in a temper.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you who would put you in the humor, perhaps,” said Mary\r\nreflecting. She felt as if she would like this thing to be settled one\r\nway or the other. “I believe Dickon would. He’s always talking about\r\nlive things. He never talks about dead things or things that are ill.\r\nHe’s always looking up in the sky to watch birds flying—or looking down\r\nat the earth to see something growing. He has such round blue eyes and\r\nthey are so wide open with looking about. And he laughs such a big\r\nlaugh with his wide mouth—and his cheeks are as red—as red as\r\ncherries.”\r\n\r\nShe pulled her stool nearer to the sofa and her expression quite\r\nchanged at the remembrance of the wide curving mouth and wide open\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n“See here,” she said. “Don’t let us talk about dying; I don’t like it.\r\nLet us talk about living. Let us talk and talk about Dickon. And then\r\nwe will look at your pictures.”\r\n\r\nIt was the best thing she could have said. To talk about Dickon meant\r\nto talk about the moor and about the cottage and the fourteen people\r\nwho lived in it on sixteen shillings a week—and the children who got\r\nfat on the moor grass like the wild ponies. And about Dickon’s\r\nmother—and the skipping-rope—and the moor with the sun on it—and about\r\npale green points sticking up out of the black sod. And it was all so\r\nalive that Mary talked more than she had ever talked before—and Colin\r\nboth talked and listened as he had never done either before. And they\r\nboth began to laugh over nothings as children will when they are happy\r\ntogether. And they laughed so that in the end they were making as much\r\nnoise as if they had been two ordinary healthy natural ten-year-old\r\ncreatures—instead of a hard, little, unloving girl and a sickly boy who\r\nbelieved that he was going to die.\r\n\r\nThey enjoyed themselves so much that they forgot the pictures and they\r\nforgot about the time. They had been laughing quite loudly over Ben\r\nWeatherstaff and his robin, and Colin was actually sitting up as if he\r\nhad forgotten about his weak back, when he suddenly remembered\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n“Do you know there is one thing we have never once thought of,” he\r\nsaid. “We are cousins.”\r\n\r\nIt seemed so queer that they had talked so much and never remembered\r\nthis simple thing that they laughed more than ever, because they had\r\ngot into the humor to laugh at anything. And in the midst of the fun\r\nthe door opened and in walked Dr. Craven and Mrs. Medlock.\r\n\r\nDr. Craven started in actual alarm and Mrs. Medlock almost fell back\r\nbecause he had accidentally bumped against her.\r\n\r\n“Good Lord!” exclaimed poor Mrs. Medlock with her eyes almost starting\r\nout of her head. “Good Lord!”\r\n\r\n“What is this?” said Dr. Craven, coming forward. “What does it mean?”\r\n\r\nThen Mary was reminded of the boy Rajah again. Colin answered as if\r\nneither the doctor’s alarm nor Mrs. Medlock’s terror were of the\r\nslightest consequence. He was as little disturbed or frightened as if\r\nan elderly cat and dog had walked into the room.\r\n\r\n“This is my cousin, Mary Lennox,” he said. “I asked her to come and\r\ntalk to me. I like her. She must come and talk to me whenever I send\r\nfor her.”\r\n\r\nDr. Craven turned reproachfully to Mrs. Medlock.\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir” she panted. “I don’t know how it’s happened. There’s not a\r\nservant on the place tha’d dare to talk—they all have their orders.”\r\n\r\n“Nobody told her anything,” said Colin. “She heard me crying and found\r\nme herself. I am glad she came. Don’t be silly, Medlock.”\r\n\r\nMary saw that Dr. Craven did not look pleased, but it was quite plain\r\nthat he dare not oppose his patient. He sat down by Colin and felt his\r\npulse.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid there has been too much excitement. Excitement is not good\r\nfor you, my boy,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I should be excited if she kept away,” answered Colin, his eyes\r\nbeginning to look dangerously sparkling. “I am better. She makes me\r\nbetter. The nurse must bring up her tea with mine. We will have tea\r\ntogether.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Medlock and Dr. Craven looked at each other in a troubled way, but\r\nthere was evidently nothing to be done.\r\n\r\n“He does look rather better, sir,” ventured Mrs. Medlock.\r\n“But”—thinking the matter over—“he looked better this morning before\r\nshe came into the room.”\r\n\r\n“She came into the room last night. She stayed with me a long time. She\r\nsang a Hindustani song to me and it made me go to sleep,” said Colin.\r\n“I was better when I wakened up. I wanted my breakfast. I want my tea\r\nnow. Tell nurse, Medlock.”\r\n\r\nDr. Craven did not stay very long. He talked to the nurse for a few\r\nminutes when she came into the room and said a few words of warning to\r\nColin. He must not talk too much; he must not forget that he was ill;\r\nhe must not forget that he was very easily tired. Mary thought that\r\nthere seemed to be a number of uncomfortable things he was not to\r\nforget.\r\n\r\nColin looked fretful and kept his strange black-lashed eyes fixed on\r\nDr. Craven’s face.\r\n\r\n“I _want_ to forget it,” he said at last. “She makes me forget it. That\r\nis why I want her.”\r\n\r\nDr. Craven did not look happy when he left the room. He gave a puzzled\r\nglance at the little girl sitting on the large stool. She had become a\r\nstiff, silent child again as soon as he entered and he could not see\r\nwhat the attraction was. The boy actually did look brighter,\r\nhowever—and he sighed rather heavily as he went down the corridor.\r\n\r\n“They are always wanting me to eat things when I don’t want to,” said\r\nColin, as the nurse brought in the tea and put it on the table by the\r\nsofa. “Now, if you’ll eat I will. Those muffins look so nice and hot.\r\nTell me about Rajahs.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\nNEST BUILDING\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter another week of rain the high arch of blue sky appeared again and\r\nthe sun which poured down was quite hot. Though there had been no\r\nchance to see either the secret garden or Dickon, Mistress Mary had\r\nenjoyed herself very much. The week had not seemed long. She had spent\r\nhours of every day with Colin in his room, talking about Rajahs or\r\ngardens or Dickon and the cottage on the moor. They had looked at the\r\nsplendid books and pictures and sometimes Mary had read things to\r\nColin, and sometimes he had read a little to her. When he was amused\r\nand interested she thought he scarcely looked like an invalid at all,\r\nexcept that his face was so colorless and he was always on the sofa.\r\n\r\n“You are a sly young one to listen and get out of your bed to go\r\nfollowing things up like you did that night,” Mrs. Medlock said once.\r\n“But there’s no saying it’s not been a sort of blessing to the lot of\r\nus. He’s not had a tantrum or a whining fit since you made friends. The\r\nnurse was just going to give up the case because she was so sick of\r\nhim, but she says she doesn’t mind staying now you’ve gone on duty with\r\nher,” laughing a little.\r\n\r\nIn her talks with Colin, Mary had tried to be very cautious about the\r\nsecret garden. There were certain things she wanted to find out from\r\nhim, but she felt that she must find them out without asking him direct\r\nquestions. In the first place, as she began to like to be with him, she\r\nwanted to discover whether he was the kind of boy you could tell a\r\nsecret to. He was not in the least like Dickon, but he was evidently so\r\npleased with the idea of a garden no one knew anything about that she\r\nthought perhaps he could be trusted. But she had not known him long\r\nenough to be sure. The second thing she wanted to find out was this: If\r\nhe could be trusted—if he really could—wouldn’t it be possible to take\r\nhim to the garden without having anyone find it out? The grand doctor\r\nhad said that he must have fresh air and Colin had said that he would\r\nnot mind fresh air in a secret garden. Perhaps if he had a great deal\r\nof fresh air and knew Dickon and the robin and saw things growing he\r\nmight not think so much about dying. Mary had seen herself in the glass\r\nsometimes lately when she had realized that she looked quite a\r\ndifferent creature from the child she had seen when she arrived from\r\nIndia. This child looked nicer. Even Martha had seen a change in her.\r\n\r\n“Th’ air from th’ moor has done thee good already,” she had said.\r\n“Tha’rt not nigh so yeller and tha’rt not nigh so scrawny. Even tha’\r\nhair doesn’t slamp down on tha’ head so flat. It’s got some life in it\r\nso as it sticks out a bit.”\r\n\r\n“It’s like me,” said Mary. “It’s growing stronger and fatter. I’m sure\r\nthere’s more of it.”\r\n\r\n“It looks it, for sure,” said Martha, ruffling it up a little round her\r\nface. “Tha’rt not half so ugly when it’s that way an’ there’s a bit o’\r\nred in tha’ cheeks.”\r\n\r\nIf gardens and fresh air had been good for her perhaps they would be\r\ngood for Colin. But then, if he hated people to look at him, perhaps he\r\nwould not like to see Dickon.\r\n\r\n“Why does it make you angry when you are looked at?” she inquired one\r\nday.\r\n\r\n“I always hated it,” he answered, “even when I was very little. Then\r\nwhen they took me to the seaside and I used to lie in my carriage\r\neverybody used to stare and ladies would stop and talk to my nurse and\r\nthen they would begin to whisper and I knew then they were saying I\r\nshouldn’t live to grow up. Then sometimes the ladies would pat my\r\ncheeks and say ‘Poor child!’ Once when a lady did that I screamed out\r\nloud and bit her hand. She was so frightened she ran away.”\r\n\r\n“She thought you had gone mad like a dog,” said Mary, not at all\r\nadmiringly.\r\n\r\n“I don’t care what she thought,” said Colin, frowning.\r\n\r\n“I wonder why you didn’t scream and bite me when I came into your\r\nroom?” said Mary. Then she began to smile slowly.\r\n\r\n“I thought you were a ghost or a dream,” he said. “You can’t bite a\r\nghost or a dream, and if you scream they don’t care.”\r\n\r\n“Would you hate it if—if a boy looked at you?” Mary asked uncertainly.\r\n\r\nHe lay back on his cushion and paused thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n“There’s one boy,” he said quite slowly, as if he were thinking over\r\nevery word, “there’s one boy I believe I shouldn’t mind. It’s that boy\r\nwho knows where the foxes live—Dickon.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sure you wouldn’t mind him,” said Mary.\r\n\r\n“The birds don’t and other animals,” he said, still thinking it over,\r\n“perhaps that’s why I shouldn’t. He’s a sort of animal charmer and I am\r\na boy animal.”\r\n\r\nThen he laughed and she laughed too; in fact it ended in their both\r\nlaughing a great deal and finding the idea of a boy animal hiding in\r\nhis hole very funny indeed.\r\n\r\nWhat Mary felt afterward was that she need not fear about Dickon.\r\n\r\nOn that first morning when the sky was blue again Mary wakened very\r\nearly. The sun was pouring in slanting rays through the blinds and\r\nthere was something so joyous in the sight of it that she jumped out of\r\nbed and ran to the window. She drew up the blinds and opened the window\r\nitself and a great waft of fresh, scented air blew in upon her. The\r\nmoor was blue and the whole world looked as if something Magic had\r\nhappened to it. There were tender little fluting sounds here and there\r\nand everywhere, as if scores of birds were beginning to tune up for a\r\nconcert. Mary put her hand out of the window and held it in the sun.\r\n\r\n“It’s warm—warm!” she said. “It will make the green points push up and\r\nup and up, and it will make the bulbs and roots work and struggle with\r\nall their might under the earth.”\r\n\r\nShe kneeled down and leaned out of the window as far as she could,\r\nbreathing big breaths and sniffing the air until she laughed because\r\nshe remembered what Dickon’s mother had said about the end of his nose\r\nquivering like a rabbit’s.\r\n\r\n“It must be very early,” she said. “The little clouds are all pink and\r\nI’ve never seen the sky look like this. No one is up. I don’t even hear\r\nthe stable boys.”\r\n\r\nA sudden thought made her scramble to her feet.\r\n\r\n“I can’t wait! I am going to see the garden!”\r\n\r\nShe had learned to dress herself by this time and she put on her\r\nclothes in five minutes. She knew a small side door which she could\r\nunbolt herself and she flew downstairs in her stocking feet and put on\r\nher shoes in the hall. She unchained and unbolted and unlocked and when\r\nthe door was open she sprang across the step with one bound, and there\r\nshe was standing on the grass, which seemed to have turned green, and\r\nwith the sun pouring down on her and warm sweet wafts about her and the\r\nfluting and twittering and singing coming from every bush and tree. She\r\nclasped her hands for pure joy and looked up in the sky and it was so\r\nblue and pink and pearly and white and flooded with springtime light\r\nthat she felt as if she must flute and sing aloud herself and knew that\r\nthrushes and robins and skylarks could not possibly help it. She ran\r\naround the shrubs and paths towards the secret garden.\r\n\r\n“It is all different already,” she said. “The grass is greener and\r\nthings are sticking up everywhere and things are uncurling and green\r\nbuds of leaves are showing. This afternoon I am sure Dickon will come.”\r\n\r\nThe long warm rain had done strange things to the herbaceous beds which\r\nbordered the walk by the lower wall. There were things sprouting and\r\npushing out from the roots of clumps of plants and there were actually\r\nhere and there glimpses of royal purple and yellow unfurling among the\r\nstems of crocuses. Six months before Mistress Mary would not have seen\r\nhow the world was waking up, but now she missed nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen she had reached the place where the door hid itself under the ivy,\r\nshe was startled by a curious loud sound. It was the caw—caw of a crow\r\nand it came from the top of the wall, and when she looked up, there sat\r\na big glossy-plumaged blue-black bird, looking down at her very wisely\r\nindeed. She had never seen a crow so close before and he made her a\r\nlittle nervous, but the next moment he spread his wings and flapped\r\naway across the garden. She hoped he was not going to stay inside and\r\nshe pushed the door open wondering if he would. When she got fairly\r\ninto the garden she saw that he probably did intend to stay because he\r\nhad alighted on a dwarf apple-tree and under the apple-tree was lying a\r\nlittle reddish animal with a Bushy tail, and both of them were watching\r\nthe stooping body and rust-red head of Dickon, who was kneeling on the\r\ngrass working hard.\r\n\r\nMary flew across the grass to him.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Dickon! Dickon!” she cried out. “How could you get here so early!\r\nHow could you! The sun has only just got up!”\r\n\r\nHe got up himself, laughing and glowing, and tousled; his eyes like a\r\nbit of the sky.\r\n\r\n“Eh!” he said. “I was up long before him. How could I have stayed abed!\r\nTh’ world’s all fair begun again this mornin’, it has. An’ it’s workin’\r\nan’ hummin’ an’ scratchin’ an’ pipin’ an’ nest-buildin’ an’ breathin’\r\nout scents, till you’ve got to be out on it ’stead o’ lyin’ on your\r\nback. When th’ sun did jump up, th’ moor went mad for joy, an’ I was in\r\nthe midst of th’ heather, an’ I run like mad myself, shoutin’ an’\r\nsingin’. An’ I come straight here. I couldn’t have stayed away. Why,\r\nth’ garden was lyin’ here waitin’!”\r\n\r\nMary put her hands on her chest, panting, as if she had been running\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Dickon! Dickon!” she said. “I’m so happy I can scarcely breathe!”\r\n\r\nSeeing him talking to a stranger, the little bushy-tailed animal rose\r\nfrom its place under the tree and came to him, and the rook, cawing\r\nonce, flew down from its branch and settled quietly on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“This is th’ little fox cub,” he said, rubbing the little reddish\r\nanimal’s head. “It’s named Captain. An’ this here’s Soot. Soot he flew\r\nacross th’ moor with me an’ Captain he run same as if th’ hounds had\r\nbeen after him. They both felt same as I did.”\r\n\r\nNeither of the creatures looked as if he were the least afraid of Mary.\r\nWhen Dickon began to walk about, Soot stayed on his shoulder and\r\nCaptain trotted quietly close to his side.\r\n\r\n“See here!” said Dickon. “See how these has pushed up, an’ these an’\r\nthese! An’ Eh! Look at these here!”\r\n\r\nHe threw himself upon his knees and Mary went down beside him. They had\r\ncome upon a whole clump of crocuses burst into purple and orange and\r\ngold. Mary bent her face down and kissed and kissed them.\r\n\r\n“You never kiss a person in that way,” she said when she lifted her\r\nhead. “Flowers are so different.”\r\n\r\nHe looked puzzled but smiled.\r\n\r\n“Eh!” he said, “I’ve kissed mother many a time that way when I come in\r\nfrom th’ moor after a day’s roamin’ an’ she stood there at th’ door in\r\nth’ sun, lookin’ so glad an’ comfortable.”\r\n\r\nThey ran from one part of the garden to another and found so many\r\nwonders that they were obliged to remind themselves that they must\r\nwhisper or speak low. He showed her swelling leafbuds on rose branches\r\nwhich had seemed dead. He showed her ten thousand new green points\r\npushing through the mould. They put their eager young noses close to\r\nthe earth and sniffed its warmed springtime breathing; they dug and\r\npulled and laughed low with rapture until Mistress Mary’s hair was as\r\ntumbled as Dickon’s and her cheeks were almost as poppy red as his.\r\n\r\nThere was every joy on earth in the secret garden that morning, and in\r\nthe midst of them came a delight more delightful than all, because it\r\nwas more wonderful. Swiftly something flew across the wall and darted\r\nthrough the trees to a close grown corner, a little flare of\r\nred-breasted bird with something hanging from its beak. Dickon stood\r\nquite still and put his hand on Mary almost as if they had suddenly\r\nfound themselves laughing in a church.\r\n\r\n“We munnot stir,” he whispered in broad Yorkshire. “We munnot scarce\r\nbreathe. I knowed he was mate-huntin’ when I seed him last. It’s Ben\r\nWeatherstaff’s robin. He’s buildin’ his nest. He’ll stay here if us\r\ndon’t flight him.”\r\n\r\nThey settled down softly upon the grass and sat there without moving.\r\n\r\n“Us mustn’t seem as if us was watchin’ him too close,” said Dickon.\r\n“He’d be out with us for good if he got th’ notion us was interferin’\r\nnow. He’ll be a good bit different till all this is over. He’s settin’\r\nup housekeepin’. He’ll be shyer an’ readier to take things ill. He’s\r\ngot no time for visitin’ an’ gossipin’. Us must keep still a bit an’\r\ntry to look as if us was grass an’ trees an’ bushes. Then when he’s got\r\nused to seein’ us I’ll chirp a bit an’ he’ll know us’ll not be in his\r\nway.”\r\n\r\nMistress Mary was not at all sure that she knew, as Dickon seemed to,\r\nhow to try to look like grass and trees and bushes. But he had said the\r\nqueer thing as if it were the simplest and most natural thing in the\r\nworld, and she felt it must be quite easy to him, and indeed she\r\nwatched him for a few minutes carefully, wondering if it was possible\r\nfor him to quietly turn green and put out branches and leaves. But he\r\nonly sat wonderfully still, and when he spoke dropped his voice to such\r\na softness that it was curious that she could hear him, but she could.\r\n\r\n“It’s part o’ th’ springtime, this nest-buildin’ is,” he said. “I\r\nwarrant it’s been goin’ on in th’ same way every year since th’ world\r\nwas begun. They’ve got their way o’ thinkin’ and doin’ things an’ a\r\nbody had better not meddle. You can lose a friend in springtime easier\r\nthan any other season if you’re too curious.”\r\n\r\n“If we talk about him I can’t help looking at him,” Mary said as softly\r\nas possible. “We must talk of something else. There is something I want\r\nto tell you.”\r\n\r\n“He’ll like it better if us talks o’ somethin’ else,” said Dickon.\r\n“What is it tha’s got to tell me?”\r\n\r\n“Well—do you know about Colin?” she whispered.\r\n\r\nHe turned his head to look at her.\r\n\r\n“What does tha’ know about him?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I’ve seen him. I have been to talk to him every day this week. He\r\nwants me to come. He says I’m making him forget about being ill and\r\ndying,” answered Mary.\r\n\r\nDickon looked actually relieved as soon as the surprise died away from\r\nhis round face.\r\n\r\n“I am glad o’ that,” he exclaimed. “I’m right down glad. It makes me\r\neasier. I knowed I must say nothin’ about him an’ I don’t like havin’\r\nto hide things.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you like hiding the garden?” said Mary.\r\n\r\n“I’ll never tell about it,” he answered. “But I says to mother,\r\n‘Mother,’ I says, ‘I got a secret to keep. It’s not a bad ’un, tha’\r\nknows that. It’s no worse than hidin’ where a bird’s nest is. Tha’\r\ndoesn’t mind it, does tha’?’”\r\n\r\nMary always wanted to hear about mother.\r\n\r\n“What did she say?” she asked, not at all afraid to hear.\r\n\r\nDickon grinned sweet-temperedly.\r\n\r\n“It was just like her, what she said,” he answered. “She give my head a\r\nbit of a rub an’ laughed an’ she says, ‘Eh, lad, tha’ can have all th’\r\nsecrets tha’ likes. I’ve knowed thee twelve year’.’”\r\n\r\n“How did you know about Colin?” asked Mary.\r\n\r\n“Everybody as knowed about Mester Craven knowed there was a little lad\r\nas was like to be a cripple, an’ they knowed Mester Craven didn’t like\r\nhim to be talked about. Folks is sorry for Mester Craven because Mrs.\r\nCraven was such a pretty young lady an’ they was so fond of each other.\r\nMrs. Medlock stops in our cottage whenever she goes to Thwaite an’ she\r\ndoesn’t mind talkin’ to mother before us children, because she knows us\r\nhas been brought up to be trusty. How did tha’ find out about him?\r\nMartha was in fine trouble th’ last time she came home. She said tha’d\r\nheard him frettin’ an’ tha’ was askin’ questions an’ she didn’t know\r\nwhat to say.”\r\n\r\nMary told him her story about the midnight wuthering of the wind which\r\nhad wakened her and about the faint far-off sounds of the complaining\r\nvoice which had led her down the dark corridors with her candle and had\r\nended with her opening of the door of the dimly lighted room with the\r\ncarven four-posted bed in the corner. When she described the small\r\nivory-white face and the strange black-rimmed eyes Dickon shook his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n“Them’s just like his mother’s eyes, only hers was always laughin’,\r\nthey say,” he said. “They say as Mr. Craven can’t bear to see him when\r\nhe’s awake an’ it’s because his eyes is so like his mother’s an’ yet\r\nlooks so different in his miserable bit of a face.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think he wants to die?” whispered Mary.\r\n\r\n“No, but he wishes he’d never been born. Mother she says that’s th’\r\nworst thing on earth for a child. Them as is not wanted scarce ever\r\nthrives. Mester Craven he’d buy anythin’ as money could buy for th’\r\npoor lad but he’d like to forget as he’s on earth. For one thing, he’s\r\nafraid he’ll look at him some day and find he’s growed hunchback.”\r\n\r\n“Colin’s so afraid of it himself that he won’t sit up,” said Mary. “He\r\nsays he’s always thinking that if he should feel a lump coming he\r\nshould go crazy and scream himself to death.”\r\n\r\n“Eh! he oughtn’t to lie there thinkin’ things like that,” said Dickon.\r\n“No lad could get well as thought them sort o’ things.”\r\n\r\nThe fox was lying on the grass close by him, looking up to ask for a\r\npat now and then, and Dickon bent down and rubbed his neck softly and\r\nthought a few minutes in silence. Presently he lifted his head and\r\nlooked round the garden.\r\n\r\n“When first we got in here,” he said, “it seemed like everything was\r\ngray. Look round now and tell me if tha’ doesn’t see a difference.”\r\n\r\nMary looked and caught her breath a little.\r\n\r\n“Why!” she cried, “the gray wall is changing. It is as if a green mist\r\nwere creeping over it. It’s almost like a green gauze veil.”\r\n\r\n“Aye,” said Dickon. “An’ it’ll be greener and greener till th’ gray’s\r\nall gone. Can tha’ guess what I was thinkin’?”\r\n\r\n“I know it was something nice,” said Mary eagerly. “I believe it was\r\nsomething about Colin.”\r\n\r\n“I was thinkin’ that if he was out here he wouldn’t be watchin’ for\r\nlumps to grow on his back; he’d be watchin’ for buds to break on th’\r\nrose-bushes, an’ he’d likely be healthier,” explained Dickon. “I was\r\nwonderin’ if us could ever get him in th’ humor to come out here an’\r\nlie under th’ trees in his carriage.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve been wondering that myself. I’ve thought of it almost every time\r\nI’ve talked to him,” said Mary. “I’ve wondered if he could keep a\r\nsecret and I’ve wondered if we could bring him here without anyone\r\nseeing us. I thought perhaps you could push his carriage. The doctor\r\nsaid he must have fresh air and if he wants us to take him out no one\r\ndare disobey him. He won’t go out for other people and perhaps they\r\nwill be glad if he will go out with us. He could order the gardeners to\r\nkeep away so they wouldn’t find out.”\r\n\r\nDickon was thinking very hard as he scratched Captain’s back.\r\n\r\n“It’d be good for him, I’ll warrant,” he said. “Us’d not be thinkin’\r\nhe’d better never been born. Us’d be just two children watchin’ a\r\ngarden grow, an’ he’d be another. Two lads an’ a little lass just\r\nlookin’ on at th’ springtime. I warrant it’d be better than doctor’s\r\nstuff.”\r\n\r\n“He’s been lying in his room so long and he’s always been so afraid of\r\nhis back that it has made him queer,” said Mary. “He knows a good many\r\nthings out of books but he doesn’t know anything else. He says he has\r\nbeen too ill to notice things and he hates going out of doors and hates\r\ngardens and gardeners. But he likes to hear about this garden because\r\nit is a secret. I daren’t tell him much but he said he wanted to see\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“Us’ll have him out here sometime for sure,” said Dickon. “I could push\r\nhis carriage well enough. Has tha’ noticed how th’ robin an’ his mate\r\nhas been workin’ while we’ve been sittin’ here? Look at him perched on\r\nthat branch wonderin’ where it’d be best to put that twig he’s got in\r\nhis beak.”\r\n\r\nHe made one of his low whistling calls and the robin turned his head\r\nand looked at him inquiringly, still holding his twig. Dickon spoke to\r\nhim as Ben Weatherstaff did, but Dickon’s tone was one of friendly\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\n“Wheres’ever tha’ puts it,” he said, “it’ll be all right. Tha’ knew how\r\nto build tha’ nest before tha’ came out o’ th’ egg. Get on with thee,\r\nlad. Tha’st got no time to lose.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I do like to hear you talk to him!” Mary said, laughing\r\ndelightedly. “Ben Weatherstaff scolds him and makes fun of him, and he\r\nhops about and looks as if he understood every word, and I know he\r\nlikes it. Ben Weatherstaff says he is so conceited he would rather have\r\nstones thrown at him than not be noticed.”\r\n\r\nDickon laughed too and went on talking.\r\n\r\n“Tha’ knows us won’t trouble thee,” he said to the robin. “Us is near\r\nbein’ wild things ourselves. Us is nest-buildin’ too, bless thee. Look\r\nout tha’ doesn’t tell on us.”\r\n\r\nAnd though the robin did not answer, because his beak was occupied,\r\nMary knew that when he flew away with his twig to his own corner of the\r\ngarden the darkness of his dew-bright eye meant that he would not tell\r\ntheir secret for the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n“I WON’T!” SAID MARY\r\n\r\n\r\nThey found a great deal to do that morning and Mary was late in\r\nreturning to the house and was also in such a hurry to get back to her\r\nwork that she quite forgot Colin until the last moment.\r\n\r\n“Tell Colin that I can’t come and see him yet,” she said to Martha.\r\n“I’m very busy in the garden.”\r\n\r\nMartha looked rather frightened.\r\n\r\n“Eh! Miss Mary,” she said, “it may put him all out of humor when I tell\r\nhim that.”\r\n\r\nBut Mary was not as afraid of him as other people were and she was not\r\na self-sacrificing person.\r\n\r\n“I can’t stay,” she answered. “Dickon’s waiting for me;” and she ran\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was even lovelier and busier than the morning had been.\r\nAlready nearly all the weeds were cleared out of the garden and most of\r\nthe roses and trees had been pruned or dug about. Dickon had brought a\r\nspade of his own and he had taught Mary to use all her tools, so that\r\nby this time it was plain that though the lovely wild place was not\r\nlikely to become a “gardener’s garden” it would be a wilderness of\r\ngrowing things before the springtime was over.\r\n\r\n“There’ll be apple blossoms an’ cherry blossoms overhead,” Dickon said,\r\nworking away with all his might. “An’ there’ll be peach an’ plum trees\r\nin bloom against th’ walls, an’ th’ grass’ll be a carpet o’ flowers.”\r\n\r\nThe little fox and the rook were as happy and busy as they were, and\r\nthe robin and his mate flew backward and forward like tiny streaks of\r\nlightning. Sometimes the rook flapped his black wings and soared away\r\nover the tree-tops in the park. Each time he came back and perched near\r\nDickon and cawed several times as if he were relating his adventures,\r\nand Dickon talked to him just as he had talked to the robin. Once when\r\nDickon was so busy that he did not answer him at first, Soot flew on to\r\nhis shoulders and gently tweaked his ear with his large beak. When Mary\r\nwanted to rest a little Dickon sat down with her under a tree and once\r\nhe took his pipe out of his pocket and played the soft strange little\r\nnotes and two squirrels appeared on the wall and looked and listened.\r\n\r\n“Tha’s a good bit stronger than tha’ was,” Dickon said, looking at her\r\nas she was digging. “Tha’s beginning to look different, for sure.”\r\n\r\nMary was glowing with exercise and good spirits.\r\n\r\n“I’m getting fatter and fatter every day,” she said quite exultantly.\r\n“Mrs. Medlock will have to get me some bigger dresses. Martha says my\r\nhair is growing thicker. It isn’t so flat and stringy.”\r\n\r\nThe sun was beginning to set and sending deep gold-colored rays\r\nslanting under the trees when they parted.\r\n\r\n“It’ll be fine tomorrow,” said Dickon. “I’ll be at work by sunrise.”\r\n\r\n“So will I,” said Mary.\r\n\r\nShe ran back to the house as quickly as her feet would carry her. She\r\nwanted to tell Colin about Dickon’s fox cub and the rook and about what\r\nthe springtime had been doing. She felt sure he would like to hear. So\r\nit was not very pleasant when she opened the door of her room, to see\r\nMartha standing waiting for her with a doleful face.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” she asked. “What did Colin say when you told him\r\nI couldn’t come?”\r\n\r\n“Eh!” said Martha, “I wish tha’d gone. He was nigh goin’ into one o’\r\nhis tantrums. There’s been a nice to do all afternoon to keep him\r\nquiet. He would watch the clock all th’ time.”\r\n\r\nMary’s lips pinched themselves together. She was no more used to\r\nconsidering other people than Colin was and she saw no reason why an\r\nill-tempered boy should interfere with the thing she liked best. She\r\nknew nothing about the pitifulness of people who had been ill and\r\nnervous and who did not know that they could control their tempers and\r\nneed not make other people ill and nervous, too. When she had had a\r\nheadache in India she had done her best to see that everybody else also\r\nhad a headache or something quite as bad. And she felt she was quite\r\nright; but of course now she felt that Colin was quite wrong.\r\n\r\nHe was not on his sofa when she went into his room. He was lying flat\r\non his back in bed and he did not turn his head toward her as she came\r\nin. This was a bad beginning and Mary marched up to him with her stiff\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n“Why didn’t you get up?” she said.\r\n\r\n“I did get up this morning when I thought you were coming,” he\r\nanswered, without looking at her. “I made them put me back in bed this\r\nafternoon. My back ached and my head ached and I was tired. Why didn’t\r\nyou come?”\r\n\r\n“I was working in the garden with Dickon,” said Mary.\r\n\r\nColin frowned and condescended to look at her.\r\n\r\n“I won’t let that boy come here if you go and stay with him instead of\r\ncoming to talk to me,” he said.\r\n\r\nMary flew into a fine passion. She could fly into a passion without\r\nmaking a noise. She just grew sour and obstinate and did not care what\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n“If you send Dickon away, I’ll never come into this room again!” she\r\nretorted.\r\n\r\n“You’ll have to if I want you,” said Colin.\r\n\r\n“I won’t!” said Mary.\r\n\r\n“I’ll make you,” said Colin. “They shall drag you in.”\r\n\r\n“Shall they, Mr. Rajah!” said Mary fiercely. “They may drag me in but\r\nthey can’t make me talk when they get me here. I’ll sit and clench my\r\nteeth and never tell you one thing. I won’t even look at you. I’ll\r\nstare at the floor!”\r\n\r\nThey were a nice agreeable pair as they glared at each other. If they\r\nhad been two little street boys they would have sprung at each other\r\nand had a rough-and-tumble fight. As it was, they did the next thing to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“You are a selfish thing!” cried Colin.\r\n\r\n“What are you?” said Mary. “Selfish people always say that. Anyone is\r\nselfish who doesn’t do what they want. You’re more selfish than I am.\r\nYou’re the most selfish boy I ever saw.”\r\n\r\n“I’m not!” snapped Colin. “I’m not as selfish as your fine Dickon is!\r\nHe keeps you playing in the dirt when he knows I am all by myself. He’s\r\nselfish, if you like!”\r\n\r\nMary’s eyes flashed fire.\r\n\r\n“He’s nicer than any other boy that ever lived!” she said. “He’s—he’s\r\nlike an angel!” It might sound rather silly to say that but she did not\r\ncare.\r\n\r\n“A nice angel!” Colin sneered ferociously. “He’s a common cottage boy\r\noff the moor!”\r\n\r\n“He’s better than a common Rajah!” retorted Mary. “He’s a thousand\r\ntimes better!”\r\n\r\nBecause she was the stronger of the two she was beginning to get the\r\nbetter of him. The truth was that he had never had a fight with anyone\r\nlike himself in his life and, upon the whole, it was rather good for\r\nhim, though neither he nor Mary knew anything about that. He turned his\r\nhead on his pillow and shut his eyes and a big tear was squeezed out\r\nand ran down his cheek. He was beginning to feel pathetic and sorry for\r\nhimself—not for anyone else.\r\n\r\n“I’m not as selfish as you, because I’m always ill, and I’m sure there\r\nis a lump coming on my back,” he said. “And I am going to die besides.”\r\n\r\n“You’re not!” contradicted Mary unsympathetically.\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes quite wide with indignation. He had never heard such\r\na thing said before. He was at once furious and slightly pleased, if a\r\nperson could be both at one time.\r\n\r\n“I’m not?” he cried. “I am! You know I am! Everybody says so.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t believe it!” said Mary sourly. “You just say that to make\r\npeople sorry. I believe you’re proud of it. I don’t believe it! If you\r\nwere a nice boy it might be true—but you’re too nasty!”\r\n\r\nIn spite of his invalid back Colin sat up in bed in quite a healthy\r\nrage.\r\n\r\n“Get out of the room!” he shouted and he caught hold of his pillow and\r\nthrew it at her. He was not strong enough to throw it far and it only\r\nfell at her feet, but Mary’s face looked as pinched as a nutcracker.\r\n\r\n“I’m going,” she said. “And I won’t come back!”\r\n\r\nShe walked to the door and when she reached it she turned round and\r\nspoke again.\r\n\r\n“I was going to tell you all sorts of nice things,” she said. “Dickon\r\nbrought his fox and his rook and I was going to tell you all about\r\nthem. Now I won’t tell you a single thing!”\r\n\r\nShe marched out of the door and closed it behind her, and there to her\r\ngreat astonishment she found the trained nurse standing as if she had\r\nbeen listening and, more amazing still—she was laughing. She was a big\r\nhandsome young woman who ought not to have been a trained nurse at all,\r\nas she could not bear invalids and she was always making excuses to\r\nleave Colin to Martha or anyone else who would take her place. Mary had\r\nnever liked her, and she simply stood and gazed up at her as she stood\r\ngiggling into her handkerchief..\r\n\r\n“What are you laughing at?” she asked her.\r\n\r\n“At you two young ones,” said the nurse. “It’s the best thing that\r\ncould happen to the sickly pampered thing to have someone to stand up\r\nto him that’s as spoiled as himself;” and she laughed into her\r\nhandkerchief again. “If he’d had a young vixen of a sister to fight\r\nwith it would have been the saving of him.”\r\n\r\n“Is he going to die?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know and I don’t care,” said the nurse. “Hysterics and temper\r\nare half what ails him.”\r\n\r\n“What are hysterics?” asked Mary.\r\n\r\n“You’ll find out if you work him into a tantrum after this—but at any\r\nrate you’ve given him something to have hysterics about, and I’m glad\r\nof it.”\r\n\r\nMary went back to her room not feeling at all as she had felt when she\r\nhad come in from the garden. She was cross and disappointed but not at\r\nall sorry for Colin. She had looked forward to telling him a great many\r\nthings and she had meant to try to make up her mind whether it would be\r\nsafe to trust him with the great secret. She had been beginning to\r\nthink it would be, but now she had changed her mind entirely. She would\r\nnever tell him and he could stay in his room and never get any fresh\r\nair and die if he liked! It would serve him right! She felt so sour and\r\nunrelenting that for a few minutes she almost forgot about Dickon and\r\nthe green veil creeping over the world and the soft wind blowing down\r\nfrom the moor.\r\n\r\nMartha was waiting for her and the trouble in her face had been\r\ntemporarily replaced by interest and curiosity. There was a wooden box\r\non the table and its cover had been removed and revealed that it was\r\nfull of neat packages.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Craven sent it to you,” said Martha. “It looks as if it had\r\npicture-books in it.”\r\n\r\nMary remembered what he had asked her the day she had gone to his room.\r\n“Do you want anything—dolls—toys—books?” She opened the package\r\nwondering if he had sent a doll, and also wondering what she should do\r\nwith it if he had. But he had not sent one. There were several\r\nbeautiful books such as Colin had, and two of them were about gardens\r\nand were full of pictures. There were two or three games and there was\r\na beautiful little writing-case with a gold monogram on it and a gold\r\npen and inkstand.\r\n\r\nEverything was so nice that her pleasure began to crowd her anger out\r\nof her mind. She had not expected him to remember her at all and her\r\nhard little heart grew quite warm.\r\n\r\n“I can write better than I can print,” she said, “and the first thing I\r\nshall write with that pen will be a letter to tell him I am much\r\nobliged.”\r\n\r\nIf she had been friends with Colin she would have run to show him her\r\npresents at once, and they would have looked at the pictures and read\r\nsome of the gardening books and perhaps tried playing the games, and he\r\nwould have enjoyed himself so much he would never once have thought he\r\nwas going to die or have put his hand on his spine to see if there was\r\na lump coming. He had a way of doing that which she could not bear. It\r\ngave her an uncomfortable frightened feeling because he always looked\r\nso frightened himself. He said that if he felt even quite a little lump\r\nsome day he should know his hunch had begun to grow. Something he had\r\nheard Mrs. Medlock whispering to the nurse had given him the idea and\r\nhe had thought over it in secret until it was quite firmly fixed in his\r\nmind. Mrs. Medlock had said his father’s back had begun to show its\r\ncrookedness in that way when he was a child. He had never told anyone\r\nbut Mary that most of his “tantrums” as they called them grew out of\r\nhis hysterical hidden fear. Mary had been sorry for him when he had\r\ntold her.\r\n\r\n“He always began to think about it when he was cross or tired,” she\r\nsaid to herself. “And he has been cross today. Perhaps—perhaps he has\r\nbeen thinking about it all afternoon.”\r\n\r\nShe stood still, looking down at the carpet and thinking.\r\n\r\n“I said I would never go back again—” she hesitated, knitting her\r\nbrows—“but perhaps, just perhaps, I will go and see—if he wants me—in\r\nthe morning. Perhaps he’ll try to throw his pillow at me again, but—I\r\nthink—I’ll go.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\nA TANTRUM\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had got up very early in the morning and had worked hard in the\r\ngarden and she was tired and sleepy, so as soon as Martha had brought\r\nher supper and she had eaten it, she was glad to go to bed. As she laid\r\nher head on the pillow she murmured to herself:\r\n\r\n“I’ll go out before breakfast and work with Dickon and then afterward—I\r\nbelieve—I’ll go to see him.”\r\n\r\nShe thought it was the middle of the night when she was awakened by\r\nsuch dreadful sounds that she jumped out of bed in an instant. What was\r\nit—what was it? The next minute she felt quite sure she knew. Doors\r\nwere opened and shut and there were hurrying feet in the corridors and\r\nsomeone was crying and screaming at the same time, screaming and crying\r\nin a horrible way.\r\n\r\n“It’s Colin,” she said. “He’s having one of those tantrums the nurse\r\ncalled hysterics. How awful it sounds.”\r\n\r\nAs she listened to the sobbing screams she did not wonder that people\r\nwere so frightened that they gave him his own way in everything rather\r\nthan hear them. She put her hands over her ears and felt sick and\r\nshivering.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do,” she kept saying. “I\r\ncan’t bear it.”\r\n\r\nOnce she wondered if he would stop if she dared go to him and then she\r\nremembered how he had driven her out of the room and thought that\r\nperhaps the sight of her might make him worse. Even when she pressed\r\nher hands more tightly over her ears she could not keep the awful\r\nsounds out. She hated them so and was so terrified by them that\r\nsuddenly they began to make her angry and she felt as if she should\r\nlike to fly into a tantrum herself and frighten him as he was\r\nfrightening her. She was not used to anyone’s tempers but her own. She\r\ntook her hands from her ears and sprang up and stamped her foot.\r\n\r\n“He ought to be stopped! Somebody ought to make him stop! Somebody\r\nought to beat him!” she cried out.\r\n\r\nJust then she heard feet almost running down the corridor and her door\r\nopened and the nurse came in. She was not laughing now by any means.\r\nShe even looked rather pale.\r\n\r\n“He’s worked himself into hysterics,” she said in a great hurry. “He’ll\r\ndo himself harm. No one can do anything with him. You come and try,\r\nlike a good child. He likes you.”\r\n\r\n“He turned me out of the room this morning,” said Mary, stamping her\r\nfoot with excitement.\r\n\r\nThe stamp rather pleased the nurse. The truth was that she had been\r\nafraid she might find Mary crying and hiding her head under the\r\nbed-clothes.\r\n\r\n“That’s right,” she said. “You’re in the right humor. You go and scold\r\nhim. Give him something new to think of. Do go, child, as quick as ever\r\nyou can.”\r\n\r\nIt was not until afterward that Mary realized that the thing had been\r\nfunny as well as dreadful—that it was funny that all the grown-up\r\npeople were so frightened that they came to a little girl just because\r\nthey guessed she was almost as bad as Colin himself.\r\n\r\nShe flew along the corridor and the nearer she got to the screams the\r\nhigher her temper mounted. She felt quite wicked by the time she\r\nreached the door. She slapped it open with her hand and ran across the\r\nroom to the four-posted bed.\r\n\r\n“You stop!” she almost shouted. “You stop! I hate you! Everybody hates\r\nyou! I wish everybody would run out of the house and let you scream\r\nyourself to death! You _will_ scream yourself to death in a minute, and\r\nI wish you would!”\r\n\r\nA nice sympathetic child could neither have thought nor said such\r\nthings, but it just happened that the shock of hearing them was the\r\nbest possible thing for this hysterical boy whom no one had ever dared\r\nto restrain or contradict.\r\n\r\nHe had been lying on his face beating his pillow with his hands and he\r\nactually almost jumped around, he turned so quickly at the sound of the\r\nfurious little voice. His face looked dreadful, white and red and\r\nswollen, and he was gasping and choking; but savage little Mary did not\r\ncare an atom.\r\n\r\n“If you scream another scream,” she said, “I’ll scream too—and I can\r\nscream louder than you can and I’ll frighten you, I’ll frighten you!”\r\n\r\nHe actually had stopped screaming because she had startled him so. The\r\nscream which had been coming almost choked him. The tears were\r\nstreaming down his face and he shook all over.\r\n\r\n“I can’t stop!” he gasped and sobbed. “I can’t—I can’t!”\r\n\r\n“You can!” shouted Mary. “Half that ails you is hysterics and\r\ntemper—just hysterics—hysterics—hysterics!” and she stamped each time\r\nshe said it.\r\n\r\n“I felt the lump—I felt it,” choked out Colin. “I knew I should. I\r\nshall have a hunch on my back and then I shall die,” and he began to\r\nwrithe again and turned on his face and sobbed and wailed but he didn’t\r\nscream.\r\n\r\n“You didn’t feel a lump!” contradicted Mary fiercely. “If you did it\r\nwas only a hysterical lump. Hysterics makes lumps. There’s nothing the\r\nmatter with your horrid back—nothing but hysterics! Turn over and let\r\nme look at it!”\r\n\r\nShe liked the word “hysterics” and felt somehow as if it had an effect\r\non him. He was probably like herself and had never heard it before.\r\n\r\n“Nurse,” she commanded, “come here and show me his back this minute!”\r\n\r\nThe nurse, Mrs. Medlock and Martha had been standing huddled together\r\nnear the door staring at her, their mouths half open. All three had\r\ngasped with fright more than once. The nurse came forward as if she\r\nwere half afraid. Colin was heaving with great breathless sobs.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he—he won’t let me,” she hesitated in a low voice.\r\n\r\nColin heard her, however, and he gasped out between two sobs:\r\n\r\n“Sh-show her! She-she’ll see then!”\r\n\r\nIt was a poor thin back to look at when it was bared. Every rib could\r\nbe counted and every joint of the spine, though Mistress Mary did not\r\ncount them as she bent over and examined them with a solemn savage\r\nlittle face. She looked so sour and old-fashioned that the nurse turned\r\nher head aside to hide the twitching of her mouth. There was just a\r\nminute’s silence, for even Colin tried to hold his breath while Mary\r\nlooked up and down his spine, and down and up, as intently as if she\r\nhad been the great doctor from London.\r\n\r\n“There’s not a single lump there!” she said at last. “There’s not a\r\nlump as big as a pin—except backbone lumps, and you can only feel them\r\nbecause you’re thin. I’ve got backbone lumps myself, and they used to\r\nstick out as much as yours do, until I began to get fatter, and I am\r\nnot fat enough yet to hide them. There’s not a lump as big as a pin! If\r\nyou ever say there is again, I shall laugh!”\r\n\r\nNo one but Colin himself knew what effect those crossly spoken childish\r\nwords had on him. If he had ever had anyone to talk to about his secret\r\nterrors—if he had ever dared to let himself ask questions—if he had had\r\nchildish companions and had not lain on his back in the huge closed\r\nhouse, breathing an atmosphere heavy with the fears of people who were\r\nmost of them ignorant and tired of him, he would have found out that\r\nmost of his fright and illness was created by himself. But he had lain\r\nand thought of himself and his aches and weariness for hours and days\r\nand months and years. And now that an angry unsympathetic little girl\r\ninsisted obstinately that he was not as ill as he thought he was he\r\nactually felt as if she might be speaking the truth.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t know,” ventured the nurse, “that he thought he had a lump on\r\nhis spine. His back is weak because he won’t try to sit up. I could\r\nhave told him there was no lump there.” Colin gulped and turned his\r\nface a little to look at her.\r\n\r\n“C-could you?” he said pathetically.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“There!” said Mary, and she gulped too.\r\n\r\nColin turned on his face again and but for his long-drawn broken\r\nbreaths, which were the dying down of his storm of sobbing, he lay\r\nstill for a minute, though great tears streamed down his face and wet\r\nthe pillow. Actually the tears meant that a curious great relief had\r\ncome to him. Presently he turned and looked at the nurse again and\r\nstrangely enough he was not like a Rajah at all as he spoke to her.\r\n\r\n“Do you think—I could—live to grow up?” he said.\r\n\r\nThe nurse was neither clever nor soft-hearted but she could repeat some\r\nof the London doctor’s words.\r\n\r\n“You probably will if you will do what you are told to do and not give\r\nway to your temper, and stay out a great deal in the fresh air.”\r\n\r\nColin’s tantrum had passed and he was weak and worn out with crying and\r\nthis perhaps made him feel gentle. He put out his hand a little toward\r\nMary, and I am glad to say that, her own tantum having passed, she was\r\nsoftened too and met him half-way with her hand, so that it was a sort\r\nof making up.\r\n\r\n“I’ll—I’ll go out with you, Mary,” he said. “I shan’t hate fresh air if\r\nwe can find—” He remembered just in time to stop himself from saying\r\n“if we can find the secret garden” and he ended, “I shall like to go\r\nout with you if Dickon will come and push my chair. I do so want to see\r\nDickon and the fox and the crow.”\r\n\r\nThe nurse remade the tumbled bed and shook and straightened the\r\npillows. Then she made Colin a cup of beef tea and gave a cup to Mary,\r\nwho really was very glad to get it after her excitement. Mrs. Medlock\r\nand Martha gladly slipped away, and after everything was neat and calm\r\nand in order the nurse looked as if she would very gladly slip away\r\nalso. She was a healthy young woman who resented being robbed of her\r\nsleep and she yawned quite openly as she looked at Mary, who had pushed\r\nher big footstool close to the four-posted bed and was holding Colin’s\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n“You must go back and get your sleep out,” she said. “He’ll drop off\r\nafter a while—if he’s not too upset. Then I’ll lie down myself in the\r\nnext room.”\r\n\r\n“Would you like me to sing you that song I learned from my Ayah?” Mary\r\nwhispered to Colin.\r\n\r\nHis hand pulled hers gently and he turned his tired eyes on her\r\nappealingly.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes!” he answered. “It’s such a soft song. I shall go to sleep in\r\na minute.”\r\n\r\n“I will put him to sleep,” Mary said to the yawning nurse. “You can go\r\nif you like.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said the nurse, with an attempt at reluctance. “If he doesn’t\r\ngo to sleep in half an hour you must call me.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” answered Mary.\r\n\r\nThe nurse was out of the room in a minute and as soon as she was gone\r\nColin pulled Mary’s hand again.\r\n\r\n“I almost told,” he said; “but I stopped myself in time. I won’t talk\r\nand I’ll go to sleep, but you said you had a whole lot of nice things\r\nto tell me. Have you—do you think you have found out anything at all\r\nabout the way into the secret garden?”\r\n\r\nMary looked at his poor little tired face and swollen eyes and her\r\nheart relented.\r\n\r\n“Ye-es,” she answered, “I think I have. And if you will go to sleep I\r\nwill tell you tomorrow.” His hand quite trembled.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Mary!” he said. “Oh, Mary! If I could get into it I think I should\r\nlive to grow up! Do you suppose that instead of singing the Ayah\r\nsong—you could just tell me softly as you did that first day what you\r\nimagine it looks like inside? I am sure it will make me go to sleep.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Mary. “Shut your eyes.”\r\n\r\nHe closed his eyes and lay quite still and she held his hand and began\r\nto speak very slowly and in a very low voice.\r\n\r\n“I think it has been left alone so long—that it has grown all into a\r\nlovely tangle. I think the roses have climbed and climbed and climbed\r\nuntil they hang from the branches and walls and creep over the\r\nground—almost like a strange gray mist. Some of them have died but\r\nmany—are alive and when the summer comes there will be curtains and\r\nfountains of roses. I think the ground is full of daffodils and\r\nsnowdrops and lilies and iris working their way out of the dark. Now\r\nthe spring has begun—perhaps—perhaps—”\r\n\r\nThe soft drone of her voice was making him stiller and stiller and she\r\nsaw it and went on.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps they are coming up through the grass—perhaps there are\r\nclusters of purple crocuses and gold ones—even now. Perhaps the leaves\r\nare beginning to break out and uncurl—and perhaps—the gray is changing\r\nand a green gauze veil is creeping—and creeping over—everything. And\r\nthe birds are coming to look at it—because it is—so safe and still. And\r\nperhaps—perhaps—perhaps—” very softly and slowly indeed, “the robin has\r\nfound a mate—and is building a nest.”\r\n\r\nAnd Colin was asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n“THA’ MUNNOT WASTE NO TIME”\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course Mary did not waken early the next morning. She slept late\r\nbecause she was tired, and when Martha brought her breakfast she told\r\nher that though Colin was quite quiet he was ill and feverish as he\r\nalways was after he had worn himself out with a fit of crying. Mary ate\r\nher breakfast slowly as she listened.\r\n\r\n“He says he wishes tha’ would please go and see him as soon as tha’\r\ncan,” Martha said. “It’s queer what a fancy he’s took to thee. Tha’ did\r\ngive it him last night for sure—didn’t tha? Nobody else would have\r\ndared to do it. Eh! poor lad! He’s been spoiled till salt won’t save\r\nhim. Mother says as th’ two worst things as can happen to a child is\r\nnever to have his own way—or always to have it. She doesn’t know which\r\nis th’ worst. Tha’ was in a fine temper tha’self, too. But he says to\r\nme when I went into his room, ‘Please ask Miss Mary if she’ll please\r\ncome an’ talk to me?’ Think o’ him saying please! Will you go, Miss?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll run and see Dickon first,” said Mary. “No, I’ll go and see Colin\r\nfirst and tell him—I know what I’ll tell him,” with a sudden\r\ninspiration.\r\n\r\nShe had her hat on when she appeared in Colin’s room and for a second\r\nhe looked disappointed. He was in bed. His face was pitifully white and\r\nthere were dark circles round his eyes.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad you came,” he said. “My head aches and I ache all over\r\nbecause I’m so tired. Are you going somewhere?”\r\n\r\nMary went and leaned against his bed.\r\n\r\n“I won’t be long,” she said. “I’m going to Dickon, but I’ll come back.\r\nColin, it’s—it’s something about the garden.”\r\n\r\nHis whole face brightened and a little color came into it.\r\n\r\n“Oh! is it?” he cried out. “I dreamed about it all night. I heard you\r\nsay something about gray changing into green, and I dreamed I was\r\nstanding in a place all filled with trembling little green leaves—and\r\nthere were birds on nests everywhere and they looked so soft and still.\r\nI’ll lie and think about it until you come back.”\r\n\r\nIn five minutes Mary was with Dickon in their garden. The fox and the\r\ncrow were with him again and this time he had brought two tame\r\nsquirrels.\r\n\r\n“I came over on the pony this mornin’,” he said. “Eh! he is a good\r\nlittle chap—Jump is! I brought these two in my pockets. This here one\r\nhe’s called Nut an’ this here other one’s called Shell.”\r\n\r\nWhen he said “Nut” one squirrel leaped on to his right shoulder and\r\nwhen he said “Shell” the other one leaped on to his left shoulder.\r\n\r\nWhen they sat down on the grass with Captain curled at their feet, Soot\r\nsolemnly listening on a tree and Nut and Shell nosing about close to\r\nthem, it seemed to Mary that it would be scarcely bearable to leave\r\nsuch delightfulness, but when she began to tell her story somehow the\r\nlook in Dickon’s funny face gradually changed her mind. She could see\r\nhe felt sorrier for Colin than she did. He looked up at the sky and all\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\n“Just listen to them birds—th’ world seems full of ’em—all whistlin’\r\nan’ pipin’,” he said. “Look at ’em dartin’ about, an’ hearken at ’em\r\ncallin’ to each other. Come springtime seems like as if all th’ world’s\r\ncallin’. The leaves is uncurlin’ so you can see ’em—an’, my word, th’\r\nnice smells there is about!” sniffing with his happy turned-up nose.\r\n“An’ that poor lad lyin’ shut up an’ seein’ so little that he gets to\r\nthinkin’ o’ things as sets him screamin’. Eh! my! we mun get him out\r\nhere—we mun get him watchin’ an listenin’ an’ sniffin’ up th’ air an’\r\nget him just soaked through wi’ sunshine. An’ we munnot lose no time\r\nabout it.”\r\n\r\nWhen he was very much interested he often spoke quite broad Yorkshire\r\nthough at other times he tried to modify his dialect so that Mary could\r\nbetter understand. But she loved his broad Yorkshire and had in fact\r\nbeen trying to learn to speak it herself. So she spoke a little now.\r\n\r\n“Aye, that we mun,” she said (which meant “Yes, indeed, we must”).\r\n“I’ll tell thee what us’ll do first,” she proceeded, and Dickon\r\ngrinned, because when the little wench tried to twist her tongue into\r\nspeaking Yorkshire it amused him very much. “He’s took a graidely fancy\r\nto thee. He wants to see thee and he wants to see Soot an’ Captain.\r\nWhen I go back to the house to talk to him I’ll ax him if tha’ canna’\r\ncome an’ see him tomorrow mornin’—an’ bring tha’ creatures wi’ thee—an’\r\nthen—in a bit, when there’s more leaves out, an’ happen a bud or two,\r\nwe’ll get him to come out an’ tha’ shall push him in his chair an’\r\nwe’ll bring him here an’ show him everything.”\r\n\r\nWhen she stopped she was quite proud of herself. She had never made a\r\nlong speech in Yorkshire before and she had remembered very well.\r\n\r\n“Tha’ mun talk a bit o’ Yorkshire like that to Mester Colin,” Dickon\r\nchuckled. “Tha’ll make him laugh an’ there’s nowt as good for ill folk\r\nas laughin’ is. Mother says she believes as half a hour’s good laugh\r\nevery mornin’ ’ud cure a chap as was makin’ ready for typhus fever.”\r\n\r\n“I’m going to talk Yorkshire to him this very day,” said Mary,\r\nchuckling herself.\r\n\r\nThe garden had reached the time when every day and every night it\r\nseemed as if Magicians were passing through it drawing loveliness out\r\nof the earth and the boughs with wands. It was hard to go away and\r\nleave it all, particularly as Nut had actually crept on to her dress\r\nand Shell had scrambled down the trunk of the apple-tree they sat under\r\nand stayed there looking at her with inquiring eyes. But she went back\r\nto the house and when she sat down close to Colin’s bed he began to\r\nsniff as Dickon did though not in such an experienced way.\r\n\r\n“You smell like flowers and—and fresh things,” he cried out quite\r\njoyously. “What is it you smell of? It’s cool and warm and sweet all at\r\nthe same time.”\r\n\r\n“It’s th’ wind from th’ moor,” said Mary. “It comes o’ sittin’ on th’\r\ngrass under a tree wi’ Dickon an’ wi’ Captain an’ Soot an’ Nut an’\r\nShell. It’s th’ springtime an’ out o’ doors an’ sunshine as smells so\r\ngraidely.”\r\n\r\nShe said it as broadly as she could, and you do not know how broadly\r\nYorkshire sounds until you have heard someone speak it. Colin began to\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing?” he said. “I never heard you talk like that\r\nbefore. How funny it sounds.”\r\n\r\n“I’m givin’ thee a bit o’ Yorkshire,” answered Mary triumphantly. “I\r\ncanna’ talk as graidely as Dickon an’ Martha can but tha’ sees I can\r\nshape a bit. Doesn’t tha’ understand a bit o’ Yorkshire when tha’ hears\r\nit? An’ tha’ a Yorkshire lad thysel’ bred an’ born! Eh! I wonder tha’rt\r\nnot ashamed o’ thy face.”\r\n\r\nAnd then she began to laugh too and they both laughed until they could\r\nnot stop themselves and they laughed until the room echoed and Mrs.\r\nMedlock opening the door to come in drew back into the corridor and\r\nstood listening amazed.\r\n\r\n“Well, upon my word!” she said, speaking rather broad Yorkshire herself\r\nbecause there was no one to hear her and she was so astonished.\r\n“Whoever heard th’ like! Whoever on earth would ha’ thought it!”\r\n\r\nThere was so much to talk about. It seemed as if Colin could never hear\r\nenough of Dickon and Captain and Soot and Nut and Shell and the pony\r\nwhose name was Jump. Mary had run round into the wood with Dickon to\r\nsee Jump. He was a tiny little shaggy moor pony with thick locks\r\nhanging over his eyes and with a pretty face and a nuzzling velvet\r\nnose. He was rather thin with living on moor grass but he was as tough\r\nand wiry as if the muscle in his little legs had been made of steel\r\nsprings. He had lifted his head and whinnied softly the moment he saw\r\nDickon and he had trotted up to him and put his head across his\r\nshoulder and then Dickon had talked into his ear and Jump had talked\r\nback in odd little whinnies and puffs and snorts. Dickon had made him\r\ngive Mary his small front hoof and kiss her on her cheek with his\r\nvelvet muzzle.\r\n\r\n“Does he really understand everything Dickon says?” Colin asked.\r\n\r\n“It seems as if he does,” answered Mary. “Dickon says anything will\r\nunderstand if you’re friends with it for sure, but you have to be\r\nfriends for sure.”\r\n\r\nColin lay quiet a little while and his strange gray eyes seemed to be\r\nstaring at the wall, but Mary saw he was thinking.\r\n\r\n“I wish I was friends with things,” he said at last, “but I’m not. I\r\nnever had anything to be friends with, and I can’t bear people.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t you bear me?” asked Mary.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I can,” he answered. “It’s funny but I even like you.”\r\n\r\n“Ben Weatherstaff said I was like him,” said Mary. “He said he’d\r\nwarrant we’d both got the same nasty tempers. I think you are like him\r\ntoo. We are all three alike—you and I and Ben Weatherstaff. He said we\r\nwere neither of us much to look at and we were as sour as we looked.\r\nBut I don’t feel as sour as I used to before I knew the robin and\r\nDickon.”\r\n\r\n“Did you feel as if you hated people?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Mary without any affectation. “I should have detested\r\nyou if I had seen you before I saw the robin and Dickon.”\r\n\r\nColin put out his thin hand and touched her.\r\n\r\n“Mary,” he said, “I wish I hadn’t said what I did about sending Dickon\r\naway. I hated you when you said he was like an angel and I laughed at\r\nyou but—but perhaps he is.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it was rather funny to say it,” she admitted frankly, “because\r\nhis nose does turn up and he has a big mouth and his clothes have\r\npatches all over them and he talks broad Yorkshire, but—but if an angel\r\ndid come to Yorkshire and live on the moor—if there was a Yorkshire\r\nangel—I believe he’d understand the green things and know how to make\r\nthem grow and he would know how to talk to the wild creatures as Dickon\r\ndoes and they’d know he was friends for sure.”\r\n\r\n“I shouldn’t mind Dickon looking at me,” said Colin; “I want to see\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad you said that,” answered Mary, “because—because—”\r\n\r\nQuite suddenly it came into her mind that this was the minute to tell\r\nhim. Colin knew something new was coming.\r\n\r\n“Because what?” he cried eagerly.\r\n\r\nMary was so anxious that she got up from her stool and came to him and\r\ncaught hold of both his hands.\r\n\r\n“Can I trust you? I trusted Dickon because birds trusted him. Can I\r\ntrust you—for sure—_for sure?_” she implored.\r\n\r\nHer face was so solemn that he almost whispered his answer.\r\n\r\n“Yes—yes!”\r\n\r\n“Well, Dickon will come to see you tomorrow morning, and he’ll bring\r\nhis creatures with him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Oh!” Colin cried out in delight.\r\n\r\n“But that’s not all,” Mary went on, almost pale with solemn excitement.\r\n“The rest is better. There is a door into the garden. I found it. It is\r\nunder the ivy on the wall.”\r\n\r\nIf he had been a strong healthy boy Colin would probably have shouted\r\n“Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!” but he was weak and rather hysterical; his\r\neyes grew bigger and bigger and he gasped for breath.\r\n\r\n“Oh! Mary!” he cried out with a half sob. “Shall I see it? Shall I get\r\ninto it? Shall I _live_ to get into it?” and he clutched her hands and\r\ndragged her toward him.\r\n\r\n“Of course you’ll see it!” snapped Mary indignantly. “Of course you’ll\r\nlive to get into it! Don’t be silly!”\r\n\r\nAnd she was so un-hysterical and natural and childish that she brought\r\nhim to his senses and he began to laugh at himself and a few minutes\r\nafterward she was sitting on her stool again telling him not what she\r\nimagined the secret garden to be like but what it really was, and\r\nColin’s aches and tiredness were forgotten and he was listening\r\nenraptured.\r\n\r\n“It is just what you thought it would be,” he said at last. “It sounds\r\njust as if you had really seen it. You know I said that when you told\r\nme first.”\r\n\r\nMary hesitated about two minutes and then boldly spoke the truth.\r\n\r\n“I had seen it—and I had been in,” she said. “I found the key and got\r\nin weeks ago. But I daren’t tell you—I daren’t because I was so afraid\r\nI couldn’t trust you—_for sure!_”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n“IT HAS COME!”\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course Dr. Craven had been sent for the morning after Colin had had\r\nhis tantrum. He was always sent for at once when such a thing occurred\r\nand he always found, when he arrived, a white shaken boy lying on his\r\nbed, sulky and still so hysterical that he was ready to break into\r\nfresh sobbing at the least word. In fact, Dr. Craven dreaded and\r\ndetested the difficulties of these visits. On this occasion he was away\r\nfrom Misselthwaite Manor until afternoon.\r\n\r\n“How is he?” he asked Mrs. Medlock rather irritably when he arrived.\r\n“He will break a blood-vessel in one of those fits some day. The boy is\r\nhalf insane with hysteria and self-indulgence.”\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” answered Mrs. Medlock, “you’ll scarcely believe your eyes\r\nwhen you see him. That plain sour-faced child that’s almost as bad as\r\nhimself has just bewitched him. How she’s done it there’s no telling.\r\nThe Lord knows she’s nothing to look at and you scarcely ever hear her\r\nspeak, but she did what none of us dare do. She just flew at him like a\r\nlittle cat last night, and stamped her feet and ordered him to stop\r\nscreaming, and somehow she startled him so that he actually did stop,\r\nand this afternoon—well just come up and see, sir. It’s past\r\ncrediting.”\r\n\r\nThe scene which Dr. Craven beheld when he entered his patient’s room\r\nwas indeed rather astonishing to him. As Mrs. Medlock opened the door\r\nhe heard laughing and chattering. Colin was on his sofa in his\r\ndressing-gown and he was sitting up quite straight looking at a picture\r\nin one of the garden books and talking to the plain child who at that\r\nmoment could scarcely be called plain at all because her face was so\r\nglowing with enjoyment.\r\n\r\n“Those long spires of blue ones—we’ll have a lot of those,” Colin was\r\nannouncing. “They’re called Del-phin-iums.”\r\n\r\n“Dickon says they’re larkspurs made big and grand,” cried Mistress\r\nMary. “There are clumps there already.”\r\n\r\nThen they saw Dr. Craven and stopped. Mary became quite still and Colin\r\nlooked fretful.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to hear you were ill last night, my boy,” Dr. Craven said a\r\ntrifle nervously. He was rather a nervous man.\r\n\r\n“I’m better now—much better,” Colin answered, rather like a Rajah. “I’m\r\ngoing out in my chair in a day or two if it is fine. I want some fresh\r\nair.”\r\n\r\nDr. Craven sat down by him and felt his pulse and looked at him\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n“It must be a very fine day,” he said, “and you must be very careful\r\nnot to tire yourself.”\r\n\r\n“Fresh air won’t tire me,” said the young Rajah.\r\n\r\nAs there had been occasions when this same young gentleman had shrieked\r\naloud with rage and had insisted that fresh air would give him cold and\r\nkill him, it is not to be wondered at that his doctor felt somewhat\r\nstartled.\r\n\r\n“I thought you did not like fresh air,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I don’t when I am by myself,” replied the Rajah; “but my cousin is\r\ngoing out with me.”\r\n\r\n“And the nurse, of course?” suggested Dr. Craven.\r\n\r\n“No, I will not have the nurse,” so magnificently that Mary could not\r\nhelp remembering how the young native Prince had looked with his\r\ndiamonds and emeralds and pearls stuck all over him and the great\r\nrubies on the small dark hand he had waved to command his servants to\r\napproach with salaams and receive his orders.\r\n\r\n“My cousin knows how to take care of me. I am always better when she is\r\nwith me. She made me better last night. A very strong boy I know will\r\npush my carriage.”\r\n\r\nDr. Craven felt rather alarmed. If this tiresome hysterical boy should\r\nchance to get well he himself would lose all chance of inheriting\r\nMisselthwaite; but he was not an unscrupulous man, though he was a weak\r\none, and he did not intend to let him run into actual danger.\r\n\r\n“He must be a strong boy and a steady boy,” he said. “And I must know\r\nsomething about him. Who is he? What is his name?”\r\n\r\n“It’s Dickon,” Mary spoke up suddenly. She felt somehow that everybody\r\nwho knew the moor must know Dickon. And she was right, too. She saw\r\nthat in a moment Dr. Craven’s serious face relaxed into a relieved\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Dickon,” he said. “If it is Dickon you will be safe enough. He’s\r\nas strong as a moor pony, is Dickon.”\r\n\r\n“And he’s trusty,” said Mary. “He’s th’ trustiest lad i’ Yorkshire.”\r\nShe had been talking Yorkshire to Colin and she forgot herself.\r\n\r\n“Did Dickon teach you that?” asked Dr. Craven, laughing outright.\r\n\r\n“I’m learning it as if it was French,” said Mary rather coldly. “It’s\r\nlike a native dialect in India. Very clever people try to learn them. I\r\nlike it and so does Colin.”\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” he said. “If it amuses you perhaps it won’t do you any\r\nharm. Did you take your bromide last night, Colin?”\r\n\r\n“No,” Colin answered. “I wouldn’t take it at first and after Mary made\r\nme quiet she talked me to sleep—in a low voice—about the spring\r\ncreeping into a garden.”\r\n\r\n“That sounds soothing,” said Dr. Craven, more perplexed than ever and\r\nglancing sideways at Mistress Mary sitting on her stool and looking\r\ndown silently at the carpet. “You are evidently better, but you must\r\nremember—”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to remember,” interrupted the Rajah, appearing again.\r\n“When I lie by myself and remember I begin to have pains everywhere and\r\nI think of things that make me begin to scream because I hate them so.\r\nIf there was a doctor anywhere who could make you forget you were ill\r\ninstead of remembering it I would have him brought here.” And he waved\r\na thin hand which ought really to have been covered with royal signet\r\nrings made of rubies. “It is because my cousin makes me forget that she\r\nmakes me better.”\r\n\r\nDr. Craven had never made such a short stay after a “tantrum”; usually\r\nhe was obliged to remain a very long time and do a great many things.\r\nThis afternoon he did not give any medicine or leave any new orders and\r\nhe was spared any disagreeable scenes. When he went downstairs he\r\nlooked very thoughtful and when he talked to Mrs. Medlock in the\r\nlibrary she felt that he was a much puzzled man.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” she ventured, “could you have believed it?”\r\n\r\n“It is certainly a new state of affairs,” said the doctor. “And there’s\r\nno denying it is better than the old one.”\r\n\r\n“I believe Susan Sowerby’s right—I do that,” said Mrs. Medlock. “I\r\nstopped in her cottage on my way to Thwaite yesterday and had a bit of\r\ntalk with her. And she says to me, ‘Well, Sarah Ann, she mayn’t be a\r\ngood child, an’ she mayn’t be a pretty one, but she’s a child, an’\r\nchildren needs children.’ We went to school together, Susan Sowerby and\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n“She’s the best sick nurse I know,” said Dr. Craven. “When I find her\r\nin a cottage I know the chances are that I shall save my patient.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Medlock smiled. She was fond of Susan Sowerby.\r\n\r\n“She’s got a way with her, has Susan,” she went on quite volubly. “I’ve\r\nbeen thinking all morning of one thing she said yesterday. She says,\r\n‘Once when I was givin’ th’ children a bit of a preach after they’d\r\nbeen fightin’ I ses to ’em all, “When I was at school my jography told\r\nas th’ world was shaped like a orange an’ I found out before I was ten\r\nthat th’ whole orange doesn’t belong to nobody. No one owns more than\r\nhis bit of a quarter an’ there’s times it seems like there’s not enow\r\nquarters to go round. But don’t you—none o’ you—think as you own th’\r\nwhole orange or you’ll find out you’re mistaken, an’ you won’t find it\r\nout without hard knocks.” ‘What children learns from children,’ she\r\nsays, ‘is that there’s no sense in grabbin’ at th’ whole orange—peel\r\nan’ all. If you do you’ll likely not get even th’ pips, an’ them’s too\r\nbitter to eat.’”\r\n\r\n“She’s a shrewd woman,” said Dr. Craven, putting on his coat.\r\n\r\n“Well, she’s got a way of saying things,” ended Mrs. Medlock, much\r\npleased. “Sometimes I’ve said to her, ‘Eh! Susan, if you was a\r\ndifferent woman an’ didn’t talk such broad Yorkshire I’ve seen the\r\ntimes when I should have said you was clever.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night Colin slept without once awakening and when he opened his\r\neyes in the morning he lay still and smiled without knowing it—smiled\r\nbecause he felt so curiously comfortable. It was actually nice to be\r\nawake, and he turned over and stretched his limbs luxuriously. He felt\r\nas if tight strings which had held him had loosened themselves and let\r\nhim go. He did not know that Dr. Craven would have said that his nerves\r\nhad relaxed and rested themselves. Instead of lying and staring at the\r\nwall and wishing he had not awakened, his mind was full of the plans he\r\nand Mary had made yesterday, of pictures of the garden and of Dickon\r\nand his wild creatures. It was so nice to have things to think about.\r\nAnd he had not been awake more than ten minutes when he heard feet\r\nrunning along the corridor and Mary was at the door. The next minute\r\nshe was in the room and had run across to his bed, bringing with her a\r\nwaft of fresh air full of the scent of the morning.\r\n\r\n“You’ve been out! You’ve been out! There’s that nice smell of leaves!”\r\nhe cried.\r\n\r\nShe had been running and her hair was loose and blown and she was\r\nbright with the air and pink-cheeked, though he could not see it.\r\n\r\n“It’s so beautiful!” she said, a little breathless with her speed. “You\r\nnever saw anything so beautiful! It has _come!_ I thought it had come\r\nthat other morning, but it was only coming. It is here now! It has\r\ncome, the Spring! Dickon says so!”\r\n\r\n“Has it?” cried Colin, and though he really knew nothing about it he\r\nfelt his heart beat. He actually sat up in bed.\r\n\r\n“Open the window!” he added, laughing half with joyful excitement and\r\nhalf at his own fancy. “Perhaps we may hear golden trumpets!”\r\n\r\nAnd though he laughed, Mary was at the window in a moment and in a\r\nmoment more it was opened wide and freshness and softness and scents\r\nand birds’ songs were pouring through.\r\n\r\n“That’s fresh air,” she said. “Lie on your back and draw in long\r\nbreaths of it. That’s what Dickon does when he’s lying on the moor. He\r\nsays he feels it in his veins and it makes him strong and he feels as\r\nif he could live forever and ever. Breathe it and breathe it.”\r\n\r\nShe was only repeating what Dickon had told her, but she caught Colin’s\r\nfancy.\r\n\r\n“’Forever and ever’! Does it make him feel like that?” he said, and he\r\ndid as she told him, drawing in long deep breaths over and over again\r\nuntil he felt that something quite new and delightful was happening to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nMary was at his bedside again.\r\n\r\n“Things are crowding up out of the earth,” she ran on in a hurry. “And\r\nthere are flowers uncurling and buds on everything and the green veil\r\nhas covered nearly all the gray and the birds are in such a hurry about\r\ntheir nests for fear they may be too late that some of them are even\r\nfighting for places in the secret garden. And the rose-bushes look as\r\nwick as wick can be, and there are primroses in the lanes and woods,\r\nand the seeds we planted are up, and Dickon has brought the fox and the\r\ncrow and the squirrels and a new-born lamb.”\r\n\r\nAnd then she paused for breath. The new-born lamb Dickon had found\r\nthree days before lying by its dead mother among the gorse bushes on\r\nthe moor. It was not the first motherless lamb he had found and he knew\r\nwhat to do with it. He had taken it to the cottage wrapped in his\r\njacket and he had let it lie near the fire and had fed it with warm\r\nmilk. It was a soft thing with a darling silly baby face and legs\r\nrather long for its body. Dickon had carried it over the moor in his\r\narms and its feeding bottle was in his pocket with a squirrel, and when\r\nMary had sat under a tree with its limp warmness huddled on her lap she\r\nhad felt as if she were too full of strange joy to speak. A lamb—a\r\nlamb! A living lamb who lay on your lap like a baby!\r\n\r\nShe was describing it with great joy and Colin was listening and\r\ndrawing in long breaths of air when the nurse entered. She started a\r\nlittle at the sight of the open window. She had sat stifling in the\r\nroom many a warm day because her patient was sure that open windows\r\ngave people cold.\r\n\r\n“Are you sure you are not chilly, Master Colin?” she inquired.\r\n\r\n“No,” was the answer. “I am breathing long breaths of fresh air. It\r\nmakes you strong. I am going to get up to the sofa for breakfast. My\r\ncousin will have breakfast with me.”\r\n\r\nThe nurse went away, concealing a smile, to give the order for two\r\nbreakfasts. She found the servants’ hall a more amusing place than the\r\ninvalid’s chamber and just now everybody wanted to hear the news from\r\nupstairs. There was a great deal of joking about the unpopular young\r\nrecluse who, as the cook said, “had found his master, and good for\r\nhim.” The servants’ hall had been very tired of the tantrums, and the\r\nbutler, who was a man with a family, had more than once expressed his\r\nopinion that the invalid would be all the better “for a good hiding.”\r\n\r\nWhen Colin was on his sofa and the breakfast for two was put upon the\r\ntable he made an announcement to the nurse in his most Rajah-like\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n“A boy, and a fox, and a crow, and two squirrels, and a new-born lamb,\r\nare coming to see me this morning. I want them brought upstairs as soon\r\nas they come,” he said. “You are not to begin playing with the animals\r\nin the servants’ hall and keep them there. I want them here.”\r\n\r\nThe nurse gave a slight gasp and tried to conceal it with a cough.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you what you can do,” added Colin, waving his hand. “You can\r\ntell Martha to bring them here. The boy is Martha’s brother. His name\r\nis Dickon and he is an animal charmer.”\r\n\r\n“I hope the animals won’t bite, Master Colin,” said the nurse.\r\n\r\n“I told you he was a charmer,” said Colin austerely. “Charmers’ animals\r\nnever bite.”\r\n\r\n“There are snake-charmers in India,” said Mary. “And they can put their\r\nsnakes’ heads in their mouths.”\r\n\r\n“Goodness!” shuddered the nurse.\r\n\r\nThey ate their breakfast with the morning air pouring in upon them.\r\nColin’s breakfast was a very good one and Mary watched him with serious\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n“You will begin to get fatter just as I did,” she said. “I never wanted\r\nmy breakfast when I was in India and now I always want it.”\r\n\r\n“I wanted mine this morning,” said Colin. “Perhaps it was the fresh\r\nair. When do you think Dickon will come?”\r\n\r\nHe was not long in coming. In about ten minutes Mary held up her hand.\r\n\r\n“Listen!” she said. “Did you hear a caw?”\r\n\r\nColin listened and heard it, the oddest sound in the world to hear\r\ninside a house, a hoarse “caw-caw.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“That’s Soot,” said Mary. “Listen again. Do you hear a bleat—a tiny\r\none?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes!” cried Colin, quite flushing.\r\n\r\n“That’s the new-born lamb,” said Mary. “He’s coming.”\r\n\r\nDickon’s moorland boots were thick and clumsy and though he tried to\r\nwalk quietly they made a clumping sound as he walked through the long\r\ncorridors. Mary and Colin heard him marching—marching, until he passed\r\nthrough the tapestry door on to the soft carpet of Colin’s own passage.\r\n\r\n“If you please, sir,” announced Martha, opening the door, “if you\r\nplease, sir, here’s Dickon an’ his creatures.”\r\n\r\nDickon came in smiling his nicest wide smile. The new-born lamb was in\r\nhis arms and the little red fox trotted by his side. Nut sat on his\r\nleft shoulder and Soot on his right and Shell’s head and paws peeped\r\nout of his coat pocket.\r\n\r\nColin slowly sat up and stared and stared—as he had stared when he\r\nfirst saw Mary; but this was a stare of wonder and delight. The truth\r\nwas that in spite of all he had heard he had not in the least\r\nunderstood what this boy would be like and that his fox and his crow\r\nand his squirrels and his lamb were so near to him and his friendliness\r\nthat they seemed almost to be part of himself. Colin had never talked\r\nto a boy in his life and he was so overwhelmed by his own pleasure and\r\ncuriosity that he did not even think of speaking.\r\n\r\nBut Dickon did not feel the least shy or awkward. He had not felt\r\nembarrassed because the crow had not known his language and had only\r\nstared and had not spoken to him the first time they met. Creatures\r\nwere always like that until they found out about you. He walked over to\r\nColin’s sofa and put the new-born lamb quietly on his lap, and\r\nimmediately the little creature turned to the warm velvet dressing-gown\r\nand began to nuzzle and nuzzle into its folds and butt its tight-curled\r\nhead with soft impatience against his side. Of course no boy could have\r\nhelped speaking then.\r\n\r\n“What is it doing?” cried Colin. “What does it want?”\r\n\r\n“It wants its mother,” said Dickon, smiling more and more. “I brought\r\nit to thee a bit hungry because I knowed tha’d like to see it feed.”\r\n\r\nHe knelt down by the sofa and took a feeding-bottle from his pocket.\r\n\r\n“Come on, little ’un,” he said, turning the small woolly white head\r\nwith a gentle brown hand. “This is what tha’s after. Tha’ll get more\r\nout o’ this than tha’ will out o’ silk velvet coats. There now,” and he\r\npushed the rubber tip of the bottle into the nuzzling mouth and the\r\nlamb began to suck it with ravenous ecstasy.\r\n\r\nAfter that there was no wondering what to say. By the time the lamb\r\nfell asleep questions poured forth and Dickon answered them all. He\r\ntold them how he had found the lamb just as the sun was rising three\r\nmornings ago. He had been standing on the moor listening to a skylark\r\nand watching him swing higher and higher into the sky until he was only\r\na speck in the heights of blue.\r\n\r\n“I’d almost lost him but for his song an’ I was wonderin’ how a chap\r\ncould hear it when it seemed as if he’d get out o’ th’ world in a\r\nminute—an’ just then I heard somethin’ else far off among th’ gorse\r\nbushes. It was a weak bleatin’ an’ I knowed it was a new lamb as was\r\nhungry an’ I knowed it wouldn’t be hungry if it hadn’t lost its mother\r\nsomehow, so I set off searchin’. Eh! I did have a look for it. I went\r\nin an’ out among th’ gorse bushes an’ round an’ round an’ I always\r\nseemed to take th’ wrong turnin’. But at last I seed a bit o’ white by\r\na rock on top o’ th’ moor an’ I climbed up an’ found th’ little ’un\r\nhalf dead wi’ cold an’ clemmin’.”\r\n\r\nWhile he talked, Soot flew solemnly in and out of the open window and\r\ncawed remarks about the scenery while Nut and Shell made excursions\r\ninto the big trees outside and ran up and down trunks and explored\r\nbranches. Captain curled up near Dickon, who sat on the hearth-rug from\r\npreference.\r\n\r\nThey looked at the pictures in the gardening books and Dickon knew all\r\nthe flowers by their country names and knew exactly which ones were\r\nalready growing in the secret garden.\r\n\r\n“I couldna’ say that there name,” he said, pointing to one under which\r\nwas written “Aquilegia,” “but us calls that a columbine, an’ that there\r\none it’s a snapdragon and they both grow wild in hedges, but these is\r\ngarden ones an’ they’re bigger an’ grander. There’s some big clumps o’\r\ncolumbine in th’ garden. They’ll look like a bed o’ blue an’ white\r\nbutterflies flutterin’ when they’re out.”\r\n\r\n“I’m going to see them,” cried Colin. “I am going to see them!”\r\n\r\n“Aye, that tha’ mun,” said Mary quite seriously. “An’ tha’ munnot lose\r\nno time about it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n“I SHALL LIVE FOREVER—AND EVER—AND EVER!”\r\n\r\n\r\nBut they were obliged to wait more than a week because first there came\r\nsome very windy days and then Colin was threatened with a cold, which\r\ntwo things happening one after the other would no doubt have thrown him\r\ninto a rage but that there was so much careful and mysterious planning\r\nto do and almost every day Dickon came in, if only for a few minutes,\r\nto talk about what was happening on the moor and in the lanes and\r\nhedges and on the borders of streams. The things he had to tell about\r\notters’ and badgers’ and water-rats’ houses, not to mention birds’\r\nnests and field-mice and their burrows, were enough to make you almost\r\ntremble with excitement when you heard all the intimate details from an\r\nanimal charmer and realized with what thrilling eagerness and anxiety\r\nthe whole busy underworld was working.\r\n\r\n“They’re same as us,” said Dickon, “only they have to build their homes\r\nevery year. An’ it keeps ’em so busy they fair scuffle to get ’em\r\ndone.”\r\n\r\nThe most absorbing thing, however, was the preparations to be made\r\nbefore Colin could be transported with sufficient secrecy to the\r\ngarden. No one must see the chair-carriage and Dickon and Mary after\r\nthey turned a certain corner of the shrubbery and entered upon the walk\r\noutside the ivied walls. As each day passed, Colin had become more and\r\nmore fixed in his feeling that the mystery surrounding the garden was\r\none of its greatest charms. Nothing must spoil that. No one must ever\r\nsuspect that they had a secret. People must think that he was simply\r\ngoing out with Mary and Dickon because he liked them and did not object\r\nto their looking at him. They had long and quite delightful talks about\r\ntheir route. They would go up this path and down that one and cross the\r\nother and go round among the fountain flower-beds as if they were\r\nlooking at the “bedding-out plants” the head gardener, Mr. Roach, had\r\nbeen having arranged. That would seem such a rational thing to do that\r\nno one would think it at all mysterious. They would turn into the\r\nshrubbery walks and lose themselves until they came to the long walls.\r\nIt was almost as serious and elaborately thought out as the plans of\r\nmarch made by great generals in time of war.\r\n\r\nRumors of the new and curious things which were occurring in the\r\ninvalid’s apartments had of course filtered through the servants’ hall\r\ninto the stable yards and out among the gardeners, but notwithstanding\r\nthis, Mr. Roach was startled one day when he received orders from\r\nMaster Colin’s room to the effect that he must report himself in the\r\napartment no outsider had ever seen, as the invalid himself desired to\r\nspeak to him.\r\n\r\n“Well, well,” he said to himself as he hurriedly changed his coat,\r\n“what’s to do now? His Royal Highness that wasn’t to be looked at\r\ncalling up a man he’s never set eyes on.”\r\n\r\nMr. Roach was not without curiosity. He had never caught even a glimpse\r\nof the boy and had heard a dozen exaggerated stories about his uncanny\r\nlooks and ways and his insane tempers. The thing he had heard oftenest\r\nwas that he might die at any moment and there had been numerous\r\nfanciful descriptions of a humped back and helpless limbs, given by\r\npeople who had never seen him.\r\n\r\n“Things are changing in this house, Mr. Roach,” said Mrs. Medlock, as\r\nshe led him up the back staircase to the corridor on to which opened\r\nthe hitherto mysterious chamber.\r\n\r\n“Let’s hope they’re changing for the better, Mrs. Medlock,” he\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n“They couldn’t well change for the worse,” she continued; “and queer as\r\nit all is there’s them as finds their duties made a lot easier to stand\r\nup under. Don’t you be surprised, Mr. Roach, if you find yourself in\r\nthe middle of a menagerie and Martha Sowerby’s Dickon more at home than\r\nyou or me could ever be.”\r\n\r\nThere really was a sort of Magic about Dickon, as Mary always privately\r\nbelieved. When Mr. Roach heard his name he smiled quite leniently.\r\n\r\n“He’d be at home in Buckingham Palace or at the bottom of a coal mine,”\r\nhe said. “And yet it’s not impudence, either. He’s just fine, is that\r\nlad.”\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps well he had been prepared or he might have been\r\nstartled. When the bedroom door was opened a large crow, which seemed\r\nquite at home perched on the high back of a carven chair, announced the\r\nentrance of a visitor by saying “Caw—Caw” quite loudly. In spite of\r\nMrs. Medlock’s warning, Mr. Roach only just escaped being sufficiently\r\nundignified to jump backward.\r\n\r\nThe young Rajah was neither in bed nor on his sofa. He was sitting in\r\nan armchair and a young lamb was standing by him shaking its tail in\r\nfeeding-lamb fashion as Dickon knelt giving it milk from its bottle. A\r\nsquirrel was perched on Dickon’s bent back attentively nibbling a nut.\r\nThe little girl from India was sitting on a big footstool looking on.\r\n\r\n“Here is Mr. Roach, Master Colin,” said Mrs. Medlock.\r\n\r\nThe young Rajah turned and looked his servitor over—at least that was\r\nwhat the head gardener felt happened.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you are Roach, are you?” he said. “I sent for you to give you some\r\nvery important orders.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, sir,” answered Roach, wondering if he was to receive\r\ninstructions to fell all the oaks in the park or to transform the\r\norchards into water-gardens.\r\n\r\n“I am going out in my chair this afternoon,” said Colin. “If the fresh\r\nair agrees with me I may go out every day. When I go, none of the\r\ngardeners are to be anywhere near the Long Walk by the garden walls. No\r\none is to be there. I shall go out about two o’clock and everyone must\r\nkeep away until I send word that they may go back to their work.”\r\n\r\n“Very good, sir,” replied Mr. Roach, much relieved to hear that the\r\noaks might remain and that the orchards were safe.\r\n\r\n“Mary,” said Colin, turning to her, “what is that thing you say in\r\nIndia when you have finished talking and want people to go?”\r\n\r\n“You say, ‘You have my permission to go,’” answered Mary.\r\n\r\nThe Rajah waved his hand.\r\n\r\n“You have my permission to go, Roach,” he said. “But, remember, this is\r\nvery important.”\r\n\r\n“Caw—Caw!” remarked the crow hoarsely but not impolitely.\r\n\r\n“Very good, sir. Thank you, sir,” said Mr. Roach, and Mrs. Medlock took\r\nhim out of the room.\r\n\r\nOutside in the corridor, being a rather good-natured man, he smiled\r\nuntil he almost laughed.\r\n\r\n“My word!” he said, “he’s got a fine lordly way with him, hasn’t he?\r\nYou’d think he was a whole Royal Family rolled into one—Prince Consort\r\nand all.”\r\n\r\n“Eh!” protested Mrs. Medlock, “we’ve had to let him trample all over\r\neveryone of us ever since he had feet and he thinks that’s what folks\r\nwas born for.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps he’ll grow out of it, if he lives,” suggested Mr. Roach.\r\n\r\n“Well, there’s one thing pretty sure,” said Mrs. Medlock. “If he does\r\nlive and that Indian child stays here I’ll warrant she teaches him that\r\nthe whole orange does not belong to him, as Susan Sowerby says. And\r\nhe’ll be likely to find out the size of his own quarter.”\r\n\r\nInside the room Colin was leaning back on his cushions.\r\n\r\n“It’s all safe now,” he said. “And this afternoon I shall see it—this\r\nafternoon I shall be in it!”\r\n\r\nDickon went back to the garden with his creatures and Mary stayed with\r\nColin. She did not think he looked tired but he was very quiet before\r\ntheir lunch came and he was quiet while they were eating it. She\r\nwondered why and asked him about it.\r\n\r\n“What big eyes you’ve got, Colin,” she said. “When you are thinking\r\nthey get as big as saucers. What are you thinking about now?”\r\n\r\n“I can’t help thinking about what it will look like,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“The garden?” asked Mary.\r\n\r\n“The springtime,” he said. “I was thinking that I’ve really never seen\r\nit before. I scarcely ever went out and when I did go I never looked at\r\nit. I didn’t even think about it.”\r\n\r\n“I never saw it in India because there wasn’t any,” said Mary.\r\n\r\nShut in and morbid as his life had been, Colin had more imagination\r\nthan she had and at least he had spent a good deal of time looking at\r\nwonderful books and pictures.\r\n\r\n“That morning when you ran in and said ‘It’s come! It’s come!’, you\r\nmade me feel quite queer. It sounded as if things were coming with a\r\ngreat procession and big bursts and wafts of music. I’ve a picture like\r\nit in one of my books—crowds of lovely people and children with\r\ngarlands and branches with blossoms on them, everyone laughing and\r\ndancing and crowding and playing on pipes. That was why I said,\r\n‘Perhaps we shall hear golden trumpets’ and told you to throw open the\r\nwindow.”\r\n\r\n“How funny!” said Mary. “That’s really just what it feels like. And if\r\nall the flowers and leaves and green things and birds and wild\r\ncreatures danced past at once, what a crowd it would be! I’m sure\r\nthey’d dance and sing and flute and that would be the wafts of music.”\r\n\r\nThey both laughed but it was not because the idea was laughable but\r\nbecause they both so liked it.\r\n\r\nA little later the nurse made Colin ready. She noticed that instead of\r\nlying like a log while his clothes were put on he sat up and made some\r\nefforts to help himself, and he talked and laughed with Mary all the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n“This is one of his good days, sir,” she said to Dr. Craven, who\r\ndropped in to inspect him. “He’s in such good spirits that it makes him\r\nstronger.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll call in again later in the afternoon, after he has come in,” said\r\nDr. Craven. “I must see how the going out agrees with him. I wish,” in\r\na very low voice, “that he would let you go with him.”\r\n\r\n“I’d rather give up the case this moment, sir, than even stay here\r\nwhile it’s suggested,” answered the nurse. With sudden firmness.\r\n\r\n“I hadn’t really decided to suggest it,” said the doctor, with his\r\nslight nervousness. “We’ll try the experiment. Dickon’s a lad I’d trust\r\nwith a new-born child.”\r\n\r\nThe strongest footman in the house carried Colin downstairs and put him\r\nin his wheeled chair near which Dickon waited outside. After the\r\nmanservant had arranged his rugs and cushions the Rajah waved his hand\r\nto him and to the nurse.\r\n\r\n“You have my permission to go,” he said, and they both disappeared\r\nquickly and it must be confessed giggled when they were safely inside\r\nthe house.\r\n\r\nDickon began to push the wheeled chair slowly and steadily. Mistress\r\nMary walked beside it and Colin leaned back and lifted his face to the\r\nsky. The arch of it looked very high and the small snowy clouds seemed\r\nlike white birds floating on outspread wings below its crystal\r\nblueness. The wind swept in soft big breaths down from the moor and was\r\nstrange with a wild clear scented sweetness. Colin kept lifting his\r\nthin chest to draw it in, and his big eyes looked as if it were they\r\nwhich were listening—listening, instead of his ears.\r\n\r\n“There are so many sounds of singing and humming and calling out,” he\r\nsaid. “What is that scent the puffs of wind bring?”\r\n\r\n“It’s gorse on th’ moor that’s openin’ out,” answered Dickon. “Eh! th’\r\nbees are at it wonderful today.”\r\n\r\nNot a human creature was to be caught sight of in the paths they took.\r\nIn fact every gardener or gardener’s lad had been witched away. But\r\nthey wound in and out among the shrubbery and out and round the\r\nfountain beds, following their carefully planned route for the mere\r\nmysterious pleasure of it. But when at last they turned into the Long\r\nWalk by the ivied walls the excited sense of an approaching thrill made\r\nthem, for some curious reason they could not have explained, begin to\r\nspeak in whispers.\r\n\r\n“This is it,” breathed Mary. “This is where I used to walk up and down\r\nand wonder and wonder.”\r\n\r\n“Is it?” cried Colin, and his eyes began to search the ivy with eager\r\ncuriousness. “But I can see nothing,” he whispered. “There is no door.”\r\n\r\n“That’s what I thought,” said Mary.\r\n\r\nThen there was a lovely breathless silence and the chair wheeled on.\r\n\r\n“That is the garden where Ben Weatherstaff works,” said Mary.\r\n\r\n“Is it?” said Colin.\r\n\r\nA few yards more and Mary whispered again.\r\n\r\n“This is where the robin flew over the wall,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Is it?” cried Colin. “Oh! I wish he’d come again!”\r\n\r\n“And that,” said Mary with solemn delight, pointing under a big lilac\r\nbush, “is where he perched on the little heap of earth and showed me\r\nthe key.”\r\n\r\nThen Colin sat up.\r\n\r\n“Where? Where? There?” he cried, and his eyes were as big as the wolf’s\r\nin Red Riding-Hood, when Red Riding-Hood felt called upon to remark on\r\nthem. Dickon stood still and the wheeled chair stopped.\r\n\r\n“And this,” said Mary, stepping on to the bed close to the ivy, “is\r\nwhere I went to talk to him when he chirped at me from the top of the\r\nwall. And this is the ivy the wind blew back,” and she took hold of the\r\nhanging green curtain.\r\n\r\n“Oh! is it—is it!” gasped Colin.\r\n\r\n“And here is the handle, and here is the door. Dickon push him in—push\r\nhim in quickly!”\r\n\r\nAnd Dickon did it with one strong, steady, splendid push.\r\n\r\nBut Colin had actually dropped back against his cushions, even though\r\nhe gasped with delight, and he had covered his eyes with his hands and\r\nheld them there shutting out everything until they were inside and the\r\nchair stopped as if by magic and the door was closed. Not till then did\r\nhe take them away and look round and round and round as Dickon and Mary\r\nhad done. And over walls and earth and trees and swinging sprays and\r\ntendrils the fair green veil of tender little leaves had crept, and in\r\nthe grass under the trees and the gray urns in the alcoves and here and\r\nthere everywhere were touches or splashes of gold and purple and white\r\nand the trees were showing pink and snow above his head and there were\r\nfluttering of wings and faint sweet pipes and humming and scents and\r\nscents. And the sun fell warm upon his face like a hand with a lovely\r\ntouch. And in wonder Mary and Dickon stood and stared at him. He looked\r\nso strange and different because a pink glow of color had actually\r\ncrept all over him—ivory face and neck and hands and all.\r\n\r\n“I shall get well! I shall get well!” he cried out. “Mary! Dickon! I\r\nshall get well! And I shall live forever and ever and ever!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\nBEN WEATHERSTAFF\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the strange things about living in the world is that it is only\r\nnow and then one is quite sure one is going to live forever and ever\r\nand ever. One knows it sometimes when one gets up at the tender solemn\r\ndawn-time and goes out and stands alone and throws one’s head far back\r\nand looks up and up and watches the pale sky slowly changing and\r\nflushing and marvelous unknown things happening until the East almost\r\nmakes one cry out and one’s heart stands still at the strange\r\nunchanging majesty of the rising of the sun—which has been happening\r\nevery morning for thousands and thousands and thousands of years. One\r\nknows it then for a moment or so. And one knows it sometimes when one\r\nstands by oneself in a wood at sunset and the mysterious deep gold\r\nstillness slanting through and under the branches seems to be saying\r\nslowly again and again something one cannot quite hear, however much\r\none tries. Then sometimes the immense quiet of the dark blue at night\r\nwith millions of stars waiting and watching makes one sure; and\r\nsometimes a sound of far-off music makes it true; and sometimes a look\r\nin someone’s eyes.\r\n\r\nAnd it was like that with Colin when he first saw and heard and felt\r\nthe Springtime inside the four high walls of a hidden garden. That\r\nafternoon the whole world seemed to devote itself to being perfect and\r\nradiantly beautiful and kind to one boy. Perhaps out of pure heavenly\r\ngoodness the spring came and crowded everything it possibly could into\r\nthat one place. More than once Dickon paused in what he was doing and\r\nstood still with a sort of growing wonder in his eyes, shaking his head\r\nsoftly.\r\n\r\n“Eh! it is graidely,” he said. “I’m twelve goin’ on thirteen an’\r\nthere’s a lot o’ afternoons in thirteen years, but seems to me like I\r\nnever seed one as graidely as this ’ere.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, it is a graidely one,” said Mary, and she sighed for mere joy.\r\n“I’ll warrant it’s the graidelest one as ever was in this world.”\r\n\r\n“Does tha’ think,” said Colin with dreamy carefulness, “as happen it\r\nwas made loike this ’ere all o’ purpose for me?”\r\n\r\n“My word!” cried Mary admiringly, “that there is a bit o’ good\r\nYorkshire. Tha’rt shapin’ first-rate—that tha’ art.”\r\n\r\nAnd delight reigned.\r\n\r\nThey drew the chair under the plum-tree, which was snow-white with\r\nblossoms and musical with bees. It was like a king’s canopy, a fairy\r\nking’s. There were flowering cherry-trees near and apple-trees whose\r\nbuds were pink and white, and here and there one had burst open wide.\r\nBetween the blossoming branches of the canopy bits of blue sky looked\r\ndown like wonderful eyes.\r\n\r\nMary and Dickon worked a little here and there and Colin watched them.\r\nThey brought him things to look at—buds which were opening, buds which\r\nwere tight closed, bits of twig whose leaves were just showing green,\r\nthe feather of a woodpecker which had dropped on the grass, the empty\r\nshell of some bird early hatched. Dickon pushed the chair slowly round\r\nand round the garden, stopping every other moment to let him look at\r\nwonders springing out of the earth or trailing down from trees. It was\r\nlike being taken in state round the country of a magic king and queen\r\nand shown all the mysterious riches it contained.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if we shall see the robin?” said Colin.\r\n\r\n“Tha’ll see him often enow after a bit,” answered Dickon. “When th’\r\neggs hatches out th’ little chap he’ll be kep’ so busy it’ll make his\r\nhead swim. Tha’ll see him flyin’ backward an’ for’ard carryin’ worms\r\nnigh as big as himsel’ an’ that much noise goin’ on in th’ nest when he\r\ngets there as fair flusters him so as he scarce knows which big mouth\r\nto drop th’ first piece in. An’ gapin’ beaks an’ squawks on every side.\r\nMother says as when she sees th’ work a robin has to keep them gapin’\r\nbeaks filled, she feels like she was a lady with nothin’ to do. She\r\nsays she’s seen th’ little chaps when it seemed like th’ sweat must be\r\ndroppin’ off ’em, though folk can’t see it.”\r\n\r\nThis made them giggle so delightedly that they were obliged to cover\r\ntheir mouths with their hands, remembering that they must not be heard.\r\nColin had been instructed as to the law of whispers and low voices\r\nseveral days before. He liked the mysteriousness of it and did his\r\nbest, but in the midst of excited enjoyment it is rather difficult\r\nnever to laugh above a whisper.\r\n\r\nEvery moment of the afternoon was full of new things and every hour the\r\nsunshine grew more golden. The wheeled chair had been drawn back under\r\nthe canopy and Dickon had sat down on the grass and had just drawn out\r\nhis pipe when Colin saw something he had not had time to notice before.\r\n\r\n“That’s a very old tree over there, isn’t it?” he said.\r\n\r\nDickon looked across the grass at the tree and Mary looked and there\r\nwas a brief moment of stillness.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Dickon, after it, and his low voice had a very gentle\r\nsound.\r\n\r\nMary gazed at the tree and thought.\r\n\r\n“The branches are quite gray and there’s not a single leaf anywhere,”\r\nColin went on. “It’s quite dead, isn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Aye,” admitted Dickon. “But them roses as has climbed all over it will\r\nnear hide every bit o’ th’ dead wood when they’re full o’ leaves an’\r\nflowers. It won’t look dead then. It’ll be th’ prettiest of all.”\r\n\r\nMary still gazed at the tree and thought.\r\n\r\n“It looks as if a big branch had been broken off,” said Colin. “I\r\nwonder how it was done.”\r\n\r\n“It’s been done many a year,” answered Dickon. “Eh!” with a sudden\r\nrelieved start and laying his hand on Colin. “Look at that robin! There\r\nhe is! He’s been foragin’ for his mate.”\r\n\r\nColin was almost too late but he just caught sight of him, the flash of\r\nred-breasted bird with something in his beak. He darted through the\r\ngreenness and into the close-grown corner and was out of sight. Colin\r\nleaned back on his cushion again, laughing a little.\r\n\r\n“He’s taking her tea to her. Perhaps it’s five o’clock. I think I’d\r\nlike some tea myself.”\r\n\r\nAnd so they were safe.\r\n\r\n“It was Magic which sent the robin,” said Mary secretly to Dickon\r\nafterward. “I know it was Magic.” For both she and Dickon had been\r\nafraid Colin might ask something about the tree whose branch had broken\r\noff ten years ago and they had talked it over together and Dickon had\r\nstood and rubbed his head in a troubled way.\r\n\r\n“We mun look as if it wasn’t no different from th’ other trees,” he had\r\nsaid. “We couldn’t never tell him how it broke, poor lad. If he says\r\nanything about it we mun—we mun try to look cheerful.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, that we mun,” had answered Mary.\r\n\r\nBut she had not felt as if she looked cheerful when she gazed at the\r\ntree. She wondered and wondered in those few moments if there was any\r\nreality in that other thing Dickon had said. He had gone on rubbing his\r\nrust-red hair in a puzzled way, but a nice comforted look had begun to\r\ngrow in his blue eyes.\r\n\r\n“Mrs. Craven was a very lovely young lady,” he had gone on rather\r\nhesitatingly. “An’ mother she thinks maybe she’s about Misselthwaite\r\nmany a time lookin’ after Mester Colin, same as all mothers do when\r\nthey’re took out o’ th’ world. They have to come back, tha’ sees.\r\nHappen she’s been in the garden an’ happen it was her set us to work,\r\nan’ told us to bring him here.”\r\n\r\nMary had thought he meant something about Magic. She was a great\r\nbeliever in Magic. Secretly she quite believed that Dickon worked\r\nMagic, of course good Magic, on everything near him and that was why\r\npeople liked him so much and wild creatures knew he was their friend.\r\nShe wondered, indeed, if it were not possible that his gift had brought\r\nthe robin just at the right moment when Colin asked that dangerous\r\nquestion. She felt that his Magic was working all the afternoon and\r\nmaking Colin look like an entirely different boy. It did not seem\r\npossible that he could be the crazy creature who had screamed and\r\nbeaten and bitten his pillow. Even his ivory whiteness seemed to\r\nchange. The faint glow of color which had shown on his face and neck\r\nand hands when he first got inside the garden really never quite died\r\naway. He looked as if he were made of flesh instead of ivory or wax.\r\n\r\nThey saw the robin carry food to his mate two or three times, and it\r\nwas so suggestive of afternoon tea that Colin felt they must have some.\r\n\r\n“Go and make one of the men servants bring some in a basket to the\r\nrhododendron walk,” he said. “And then you and Dickon can bring it\r\nhere.”\r\n\r\nIt was an agreeable idea, easily carried out, and when the white cloth\r\nwas spread upon the grass, with hot tea and buttered toast and\r\ncrumpets, a delightfully hungry meal was eaten, and several birds on\r\ndomestic errands paused to inquire what was going on and were led into\r\ninvestigating crumbs with great activity. Nut and Shell whisked up\r\ntrees with pieces of cake and Soot took the entire half of a buttered\r\ncrumpet into a corner and pecked at and examined and turned it over and\r\nmade hoarse remarks about it until he decided to swallow it all\r\njoyfully in one gulp.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was dragging towards its mellow hour. The sun was\r\ndeepening the gold of its lances, the bees were going home and the\r\nbirds were flying past less often. Dickon and Mary were sitting on the\r\ngrass, the tea-basket was repacked ready to be taken back to the house,\r\nand Colin was lying against his cushions with his heavy locks pushed\r\nback from his forehead and his face looking quite a natural color.\r\n\r\n“I don’t want this afternoon to go,” he said; “but I shall come back\r\ntomorrow, and the day after, and the day after, and the day after.”\r\n\r\n“You’ll get plenty of fresh air, won’t you?” said Mary.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to get nothing else,” he answered. “I’ve seen the spring now\r\nand I’m going to see the summer. I’m going to see everything grow here.\r\nI’m going to grow here myself.”\r\n\r\n“That tha’ will,” said Dickon. “Us’ll have thee walkin’ about here an’\r\ndiggin’ same as other folk afore long.”\r\n\r\nColin flushed tremendously.\r\n\r\n“Walk!” he said. “Dig! Shall I?”\r\n\r\nDickon’s glance at him was delicately cautious. Neither he nor Mary had\r\never asked if anything was the matter with his legs.\r\n\r\n“For sure tha’ will,” he said stoutly. “Tha—tha’s got legs o’ thine\r\nown, same as other folks!”\r\n\r\nMary was rather frightened until she heard Colin’s answer.\r\n\r\n“Nothing really ails them,” he said, “but they are so thin and weak.\r\nThey shake so that I’m afraid to try to stand on them.”\r\n\r\nBoth Mary and Dickon drew a relieved breath.\r\n\r\n“When tha’ stops bein’ afraid tha’lt stand on ’em,” Dickon said with\r\nrenewed cheer. “An’ tha’lt stop bein’ afraid in a bit.”\r\n\r\n“I shall?” said Colin, and he lay still as if he were wondering about\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nThey were really very quiet for a little while. The sun was dropping\r\nlower. It was that hour when everything stills itself, and they really\r\nhad had a busy and exciting afternoon. Colin looked as if he were\r\nresting luxuriously. Even the creatures had ceased moving about and had\r\ndrawn together and were resting near them. Soot had perched on a low\r\nbranch and drawn up one leg and dropped the gray film drowsily over his\r\neyes. Mary privately thought he looked as if he might snore in a\r\nminute.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this stillness it was rather startling when Colin half\r\nlifted his head and exclaimed in a loud suddenly alarmed whisper:\r\n\r\n“Who is that man?”\r\n\r\nDickon and Mary scrambled to their feet.\r\n\r\n“Man!” they both cried in low quick voices.\r\n\r\nColin pointed to the high wall.\r\n\r\n“Look!” he whispered excitedly. “Just look!”\r\n\r\nMary and Dickon wheeled about and looked. There was Ben Weatherstaff’s\r\nindignant face glaring at them over the wall from the top of a ladder!\r\nHe actually shook his fist at Mary.\r\n\r\n“If I wasn’t a bachelder, an’ tha’ was a wench o’ mine,” he cried, “I’d\r\ngive thee a hidin’!”\r\n\r\nHe mounted another step threateningly as if it were his energetic\r\nintention to jump down and deal with her; but as she came toward him he\r\nevidently thought better of it and stood on the top step of his ladder\r\nshaking his fist down at her.\r\n\r\n“I never thowt much o’ thee!” he harangued. “I couldna’ abide thee th’\r\nfirst time I set eyes on thee. A scrawny buttermilk-faced young besom,\r\nallus askin’ questions an’ pokin’ tha’ nose where it wasna, wanted. I\r\nnever knowed how tha’ got so thick wi’ me. If it hadna’ been for th’\r\nrobin— Drat him—”\r\n\r\n“Ben Weatherstaff,” called out Mary, finding her breath. She stood\r\nbelow him and called up to him with a sort of gasp. “Ben Weatherstaff,\r\nit was the robin who showed me the way!”\r\n\r\nThen it did seem as if Ben really would scramble down on her side of\r\nthe wall, he was so outraged.\r\n\r\n“Tha’ young bad ’un!” he called down at her. “Layin’ tha’ badness on a\r\nrobin—not but what he’s impidint enow for anythin’. Him showin’ thee\r\nth’ way! Him! Eh! tha’ young nowt”—she could see his next words burst\r\nout because he was overpowered by curiosity—“however i’ this world did\r\ntha’ get in?”\r\n\r\n“It was the robin who showed me the way,” she protested obstinately.\r\n“He didn’t know he was doing it but he did. And I can’t tell you from\r\nhere while you’re shaking your fist at me.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped shaking his fist very suddenly at that very moment and his\r\njaw actually dropped as he stared over her head at something he saw\r\ncoming over the grass toward him.\r\n\r\nAt the first sound of his torrent of words Colin had been so surprised\r\nthat he had only sat up and listened as if he were spellbound. But in\r\nthe midst of it he had recovered himself and beckoned imperiously to\r\nDickon.\r\n\r\n“Wheel me over there!” he commanded. “Wheel me quite close and stop\r\nright in front of him!”\r\n\r\nAnd this, if you please, this is what Ben Weatherstaff beheld and which\r\nmade his jaw drop. A wheeled chair with luxurious cushions and robes\r\nwhich came toward him looking rather like some sort of State Coach\r\nbecause a young Rajah leaned back in it with royal command in his great\r\nblack-rimmed eyes and a thin white hand extended haughtily toward him.\r\nAnd it stopped right under Ben Weatherstaff’s nose. It was really no\r\nwonder his mouth dropped open.\r\n\r\n“Do you know who I am?” demanded the Rajah.\r\n\r\nHow Ben Weatherstaff stared! His red old eyes fixed themselves on what\r\nwas before him as if he were seeing a ghost. He gazed and gazed and\r\ngulped a lump down his throat and did not say a word.\r\n\r\n“Do you know who I am?” demanded Colin still more imperiously.\r\n“Answer!”\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff put his gnarled hand up and passed it over his eyes\r\nand over his forehead and then he did answer in a queer shaky voice.\r\n\r\n“Who tha’ art?” he said. “Aye, that I do—wi’ tha’ mother’s eyes starin’\r\nat me out o’ tha’ face. Lord knows how tha’ come here. But tha’rt th’\r\npoor cripple.”\r\n\r\nColin forgot that he had ever had a back. His face flushed scarlet and\r\nhe sat bolt upright.\r\n\r\n“I’m not a cripple!” he cried out furiously. “I’m not!”\r\n\r\n“He’s not!” cried Mary, almost shouting up the wall in her fierce\r\nindignation. “He’s not got a lump as big as a pin! I looked and there\r\nwas none there—not one!”\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff passed his hand over his forehead again and gazed as\r\nif he could never gaze enough. His hand shook and his mouth shook and\r\nhis voice shook. He was an ignorant old man and a tactless old man and\r\nhe could only remember the things he had heard.\r\n\r\n“Tha’—tha’ hasn’t got a crooked back?” he said hoarsely.\r\n\r\n“No!” shouted Colin.\r\n\r\n“Tha’—tha’ hasn’t got crooked legs?” quavered Ben more hoarsely yet.\r\n\r\nIt was too much. The strength which Colin usually threw into his\r\ntantrums rushed through him now in a new way. Never yet had he been\r\naccused of crooked legs—even in whispers—and the perfectly simple\r\nbelief in their existence which was revealed by Ben Weatherstaff’s\r\nvoice was more than Rajah flesh and blood could endure. His anger and\r\ninsulted pride made him forget everything but this one moment and\r\nfilled him with a power he had never known before, an almost unnatural\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n“Come here!” he shouted to Dickon, and he actually began to tear the\r\ncoverings off his lower limbs and disentangle himself. “Come here! Come\r\nhere! This minute!”\r\n\r\nDickon was by his side in a second. Mary caught her breath in a short\r\ngasp and felt herself turn pale.\r\n\r\n“He can do it! He can do it! He can do it! He can!” she gabbled over to\r\nherself under her breath as fast as ever she could.\r\n\r\nThere was a brief fierce scramble, the rugs were tossed on the ground,\r\nDickon held Colin’s arm, the thin legs were out, the thin feet were on\r\nthe grass. Colin was standing upright—upright—as straight as an arrow\r\nand looking strangely tall—his head thrown back and his strange eyes\r\nflashing lightning.\r\n\r\n“Look at me!” he flung up at Ben Weatherstaff. “Just look at me—you!\r\nJust look at me!”\r\n\r\n“He’s as straight as I am!” cried Dickon. “He’s as straight as any lad\r\ni’ Yorkshire!”\r\n\r\nWhat Ben Weatherstaff did Mary thought queer beyond measure. He choked\r\nand gulped and suddenly tears ran down his weather-wrinkled cheeks as\r\nhe struck his old hands together.\r\n\r\n“Eh!” he burst forth, “th’ lies folk tells! Tha’rt as thin as a lath\r\nan’ as white as a wraith, but there’s not a knob on thee. Tha’lt make a\r\nmon yet. God bless thee!”\r\n\r\nDickon held Colin’s arm strongly but the boy had not begun to falter.\r\nHe stood straighter and straighter and looked Ben Weatherstaff in the\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“I’m your master,” he said, “when my father is away. And you are to\r\nobey me. This is my garden. Don’t dare to say a word about it! You get\r\ndown from that ladder and go out to the Long Walk and Miss Mary will\r\nmeet you and bring you here. I want to talk to you. We did not want\r\nyou, but now you will have to be in the secret. Be quick!”\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff’s crabbed old face was still wet with that one queer\r\nrush of tears. It seemed as if he could not take his eyes from thin\r\nstraight Colin standing on his feet with his head thrown back.\r\n\r\n“Eh! lad,” he almost whispered. “Eh! my lad!” And then remembering\r\nhimself he suddenly touched his hat gardener fashion and said, “Yes,\r\nsir! Yes, sir!” and obediently disappeared as he descended the ladder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\nWHEN THE SUN WENT DOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen his head was out of sight Colin turned to Mary.\r\n\r\n“Go and meet him,” he said; and Mary flew across the grass to the door\r\nunder the ivy.\r\n\r\nDickon was watching him with sharp eyes. There were scarlet spots on\r\nhis cheeks and he looked amazing, but he showed no signs of falling.\r\n\r\n“I can stand,” he said, and his head was still held up and he said it\r\nquite grandly.\r\n\r\n“I told thee tha’ could as soon as tha’ stopped bein’ afraid,” answered\r\nDickon. “An’ tha’s stopped.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I’ve stopped,” said Colin.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he remembered something Mary had said.\r\n\r\n“Are you making Magic?” he asked sharply.\r\n\r\nDickon’s curly mouth spread in a cheerful grin.\r\n\r\n“Tha’s doin’ Magic thysel’,” he said. “It’s same Magic as made these\r\n’ere work out o’ th’ earth,” and he touched with his thick boot a clump\r\nof crocuses in the grass.\r\n\r\nColin looked down at them.\r\n\r\n“Aye,” he said slowly, “there couldna’ be bigger Magic than that\r\nthere—there couldna’ be.”\r\n\r\nHe drew himself up straighter than ever.\r\n\r\n“I’m going to walk to that tree,” he said, pointing to one a few feet\r\naway from him. “I’m going to be standing when Weatherstaff comes here.\r\nI can rest against the tree if I like. When I want to sit down I will\r\nsit down, but not before. Bring a rug from the chair.”\r\n\r\nHe walked to the tree and though Dickon held his arm he was wonderfully\r\nsteady. When he stood against the tree trunk it was not too plain that\r\nhe supported himself against it, and he still held himself so straight\r\nthat he looked tall.\r\n\r\nWhen Ben Weatherstaff came through the door in the wall he saw him\r\nstanding there and he heard Mary muttering something under her breath.\r\n\r\n“What art sayin’?” he asked rather testily because he did not want his\r\nattention distracted from the long thin straight boy figure and proud\r\nface.\r\n\r\nBut she did not tell him. What she was saying was this:\r\n\r\n“You can do it! You can do it! I told you you could! You can do it! You\r\ncan do it! You _can!_”\r\n\r\nShe was saying it to Colin because she wanted to make Magic and keep\r\nhim on his feet looking like that. She could not bear that he should\r\ngive in before Ben Weatherstaff. He did not give in. She was uplifted\r\nby a sudden feeling that he looked quite beautiful in spite of his\r\nthinness. He fixed his eyes on Ben Weatherstaff in his funny imperious\r\nway.\r\n\r\n“Look at me!” he commanded. “Look at me all over! Am I a hunchback?\r\nHave I got crooked legs?”\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff had not quite got over his emotion, but he had\r\nrecovered a little and answered almost in his usual way.\r\n\r\n“Not tha’,” he said. “Nowt o’ th’ sort. What’s tha’ been doin’ with\r\nthysel’—hidin’ out o’ sight an’ lettin’ folk think tha’ was cripple an’\r\nhalf-witted?”\r\n\r\n“Half-witted!” said Colin angrily. “Who thought that?”\r\n\r\n“Lots o’ fools,” said Ben. “Th’ world’s full o’ jackasses brayin’ an’\r\nthey never bray nowt but lies. What did tha’ shut thysel’ up for?”\r\n\r\n“Everyone thought I was going to die,” said Colin shortly. “I’m not!”\r\n\r\nAnd he said it with such decision Ben Weatherstaff looked him over, up\r\nand down, down and up.\r\n\r\n“Tha’ die!” he said with dry exultation. “Nowt o’ th’ sort! Tha’s got\r\ntoo much pluck in thee. When I seed thee put tha’ legs on th’ ground in\r\nsuch a hurry I knowed tha’ was all right. Sit thee down on th’ rug a\r\nbit young Mester an’ give me thy orders.”\r\n\r\nThere was a queer mixture of crabbed tenderness and shrewd\r\nunderstanding in his manner. Mary had poured out speech as rapidly as\r\nshe could as they had come down the Long Walk. The chief thing to be\r\nremembered, she had told him, was that Colin was getting well—getting\r\nwell. The garden was doing it. No one must let him remember about\r\nhaving humps and dying.\r\n\r\nThe Rajah condescended to seat himself on a rug under the tree.\r\n\r\n“What work do you do in the gardens, Weatherstaff?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Anythin’ I’m told to do,” answered old Ben. “I’m kep’ on by\r\nfavor—because she liked me.”\r\n\r\n“She?” said Colin.\r\n\r\n“Tha’ mother,” answered Ben Weatherstaff.\r\n\r\n“My mother?” said Colin, and he looked about him quietly. “This was her\r\ngarden, wasn’t it?”\r\n\r\n“Aye, it was that!” and Ben Weatherstaff looked about him too. “She\r\nwere main fond of it.”\r\n\r\n“It is my garden now. I am fond of it. I shall come here every day,”\r\nannounced Colin. “But it is to be a secret. My orders are that no one\r\nis to know that we come here. Dickon and my cousin have worked and made\r\nit come alive. I shall send for you sometimes to help—but you must come\r\nwhen no one can see you.”\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff’s face twisted itself in a dry old smile.\r\n\r\n“I’ve come here before when no one saw me,” he said.\r\n\r\n“What!” exclaimed Colin. “When?”\r\n\r\n“Th’ last time I was here,” rubbing his chin and looking round, “was\r\nabout two year’ ago.”\r\n\r\n“But no one has been in it for ten years!” cried Colin.\r\n\r\n“There was no door!”\r\n\r\n“I’m no one,” said old Ben dryly. “An’ I didn’t come through th’ door.\r\nI come over th’ wall. Th’ rheumatics held me back th’ last two year’.”\r\n\r\n“Tha’ come an’ did a bit o’ prunin’!” cried Dickon. “I couldn’t make\r\nout how it had been done.”\r\n\r\n“She was so fond of it—she was!” said Ben Weatherstaff slowly. “An’ she\r\nwas such a pretty young thing. She says to me once, ‘Ben,’ says she\r\nlaughin’, ‘if ever I’m ill or if I go away you must take care of my\r\nroses.’ When she did go away th’ orders was no one was ever to come\r\nnigh. But I come,” with grumpy obstinacy. “Over th’ wall I come—until\r\nth’ rheumatics stopped me—an’ I did a bit o’ work once a year. She’d\r\ngave her order first.”\r\n\r\n“It wouldn’t have been as wick as it is if tha’ hadn’t done it,” said\r\nDickon. “I did wonder.”\r\n\r\n“I’m glad you did it, Weatherstaff,” said Colin. “You’ll know how to\r\nkeep the secret.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, I’ll know, sir,” answered Ben. “An’ it’ll be easier for a man wi’\r\nrheumatics to come in at th’ door.”\r\n\r\nOn the grass near the tree Mary had dropped her trowel. Colin stretched\r\nout his hand and took it up. An odd expression came into his face and\r\nhe began to scratch at the earth. His thin hand was weak enough but\r\npresently as they watched him—Mary with quite breathless interest—he\r\ndrove the end of the trowel into the soil and turned some over.\r\n\r\n“You can do it! You can do it!” said Mary to herself. “I tell you, you\r\ncan!”\r\n\r\nDickon’s round eyes were full of eager curiousness but he said not a\r\nword. Ben Weatherstaff looked on with interested face.\r\n\r\nColin persevered. After he had turned a few trowelfuls of soil he spoke\r\nexultantly to Dickon in his best Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n“Tha’ said as tha’d have me walkin’ about here same as other folk—an’\r\ntha’ said tha’d have me diggin’. I thowt tha’ was just leein’ to please\r\nme. This is only th’ first day an’ I’ve walked—an’ here I am diggin’.”\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff’s mouth fell open again when he heard him, but he\r\nended by chuckling.\r\n\r\n“Eh!” he said, “that sounds as if tha’d got wits enow. Tha’rt a\r\nYorkshire lad for sure. An’ tha’rt diggin’, too. How’d tha’ like to\r\nplant a bit o’ somethin’? I can get thee a rose in a pot.”\r\n\r\n“Go and get it!” said Colin, digging excitedly. “Quick! Quick!”\r\n\r\nIt was done quickly enough indeed. Ben Weatherstaff went his way\r\nforgetting rheumatics. Dickon took his spade and dug the hole deeper\r\nand wider than a new digger with thin white hands could make it. Mary\r\nslipped out to run and bring back a watering-can. When Dickon had\r\ndeepened the hole Colin went on turning the soft earth over and over.\r\nHe looked up at the sky, flushed and glowing with the strangely new\r\nexercise, slight as it was.\r\n\r\n“I want to do it before the sun goes quite—quite down,” he said.\r\n\r\nMary thought that perhaps the sun held back a few minutes just on\r\npurpose. Ben Weatherstaff brought the rose in its pot from the\r\ngreenhouse. He hobbled over the grass as fast as he could. He had begun\r\nto be excited, too. He knelt down by the hole and broke the pot from\r\nthe mould.\r\n\r\n“Here, lad,” he said, handing the plant to Colin. “Set it in the earth\r\nthysel’ same as th’ king does when he goes to a new place.”\r\n\r\nThe thin white hands shook a little and Colin’s flush grew deeper as he\r\nset the rose in the mould and held it while old Ben made firm the\r\nearth. It was filled in and pressed down and made steady. Mary was\r\nleaning forward on her hands and knees. Soot had flown down and marched\r\nforward to see what was being done. Nut and Shell chattered about it\r\nfrom a cherry-tree.\r\n\r\n“It’s planted!” said Colin at last. “And the sun is only slipping over\r\nthe edge. Help me up, Dickon. I want to be standing when it goes.\r\nThat’s part of the Magic.”\r\n\r\nAnd Dickon helped him, and the Magic—or whatever it was—so gave him\r\nstrength that when the sun did slip over the edge and end the strange\r\nlovely afternoon for them there he actually stood on his two\r\nfeet—laughing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\nMAGIC\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Craven had been waiting some time at the house when they returned\r\nto it. He had indeed begun to wonder if it might not be wise to send\r\nsomeone out to explore the garden paths. When Colin was brought back to\r\nhis room the poor man looked him over seriously.\r\n\r\n“You should not have stayed so long,” he said. “You must not overexert\r\nyourself.”\r\n\r\n“I am not tired at all,” said Colin. “It has made me well. Tomorrow I\r\nam going out in the morning as well as in the afternoon.”\r\n\r\n“I am not sure that I can allow it,” answered Dr. Craven. “I am afraid\r\nit would not be wise.”\r\n\r\n“It would not be wise to try to stop me,” said Colin quite seriously.\r\n“I am going.”\r\n\r\nEven Mary had found out that one of Colin’s chief peculiarities was\r\nthat he did not know in the least what a rude little brute he was with\r\nhis way of ordering people about. He had lived on a sort of desert\r\nisland all his life and as he had been the king of it he had made his\r\nown manners and had had no one to compare himself with. Mary had indeed\r\nbeen rather like him herself and since she had been at Misselthwaite\r\nhad gradually discovered that her own manners had not been of the kind\r\nwhich is usual or popular. Having made this discovery she naturally\r\nthought it of enough interest to communicate to Colin. So she sat and\r\nlooked at him curiously for a few minutes after Dr. Craven had gone.\r\nShe wanted to make him ask her why she was doing it and of course she\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n“What are you looking at me for?” he said.\r\n\r\n“I’m thinking that I am rather sorry for Dr. Craven.”\r\n\r\n“So am I,” said Colin calmly, but not without an air of some\r\nsatisfaction. “He won’t get Misselthwaite at all now I’m not going to\r\ndie.”\r\n\r\n“I’m sorry for him because of that, of course,” said Mary, “but I was\r\nthinking just then that it must have been very horrid to have had to be\r\npolite for ten years to a boy who was always rude. I would never have\r\ndone it.”\r\n\r\n“Am I rude?” Colin inquired undisturbedly.\r\n\r\n“If you had been his own boy and he had been a slapping sort of man,”\r\nsaid Mary, “he would have slapped you.”\r\n\r\n“But he daren’t,” said Colin.\r\n\r\n“No, he daren’t,” answered Mistress Mary, thinking the thing out quite\r\nwithout prejudice. “Nobody ever dared to do anything you didn’t\r\nlike—because you were going to die and things like that. You were such\r\na poor thing.”\r\n\r\n“But,” announced Colin stubbornly, “I am not going to be a poor thing.\r\nI won’t let people think I’m one. I stood on my feet this afternoon.”\r\n\r\n“It is always having your own way that has made you so queer,” Mary\r\nwent on, thinking aloud.\r\n\r\nColin turned his head, frowning.\r\n\r\n“Am I queer?” he demanded.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered Mary, “very. But you needn’t be cross,” she added\r\nimpartially, “because so am I queer—and so is Ben Weatherstaff. But I\r\nam not as queer as I was before I began to like people and before I\r\nfound the garden.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t want to be queer,” said Colin. “I am not going to be,” and he\r\nfrowned again with determination.\r\n\r\nHe was a very proud boy. He lay thinking for a while and then Mary saw\r\nhis beautiful smile begin and gradually change his whole face.\r\n\r\n“I shall stop being queer,” he said, “if I go every day to the garden.\r\nThere is Magic in there—good Magic, you know, Mary. I am sure there\r\nis.”\r\n\r\n“So am I,” said Mary.\r\n\r\n“Even if it isn’t real Magic,” Colin said, “we can pretend it is.\r\n_Something_ is there—_something!_”\r\n\r\n“It’s Magic,” said Mary, “but not black. It’s as white as snow.”\r\n\r\nThey always called it Magic and indeed it seemed like it in the months\r\nthat followed—the wonderful months—the radiant months—the amazing ones.\r\nOh! the things which happened in that garden! If you have never had a\r\ngarden you cannot understand, and if you have had a garden you will\r\nknow that it would take a whole book to describe all that came to pass\r\nthere. At first it seemed that green things would never cease pushing\r\ntheir way through the earth, in the grass, in the beds, even in the\r\ncrevices of the walls. Then the green things began to show buds and the\r\nbuds began to unfurl and show color, every shade of blue, every shade\r\nof purple, every tint and hue of crimson. In its happy days flowers had\r\nbeen tucked away into every inch and hole and corner. Ben Weatherstaff\r\nhad seen it done and had himself scraped out mortar from between the\r\nbricks of the wall and made pockets of earth for lovely clinging things\r\nto grow on. Iris and white lilies rose out of the grass in sheaves, and\r\nthe green alcoves filled themselves with amazing armies of the blue and\r\nwhite flower lances of tall delphiniums or columbines or campanulas.\r\n\r\n“She was main fond o’ them—she was,” Ben Weatherstaff said. “She liked\r\nthem things as was allus pointin’ up to th’ blue sky, she used to tell.\r\nNot as she was one o’ them as looked down on th’ earth—not her. She\r\njust loved it but she said as th’ blue sky allus looked so joyful.”\r\n\r\nThe seeds Dickon and Mary had planted grew as if fairies had tended\r\nthem. Satiny poppies of all tints danced in the breeze by the score,\r\ngaily defying flowers which had lived in the garden for years and which\r\nit might be confessed seemed rather to wonder how such new people had\r\ngot there. And the roses—the roses! Rising out of the grass, tangled\r\nround the sun-dial, wreathing the tree trunks and hanging from their\r\nbranches, climbing up the walls and spreading over them with long\r\ngarlands falling in cascades—they came alive day by day, hour by hour.\r\nFair fresh leaves, and buds—and buds—tiny at first but swelling and\r\nworking Magic until they burst and uncurled into cups of scent\r\ndelicately spilling themselves over their brims and filling the garden\r\nair.\r\n\r\nColin saw it all, watching each change as it took place. Every morning\r\nhe was brought out and every hour of each day when it didn’t rain he\r\nspent in the garden. Even gray days pleased him. He would lie on the\r\ngrass “watching things growing,” he said. If you watched long enough,\r\nhe declared, you could see buds unsheath themselves. Also you could\r\nmake the acquaintance of strange busy insect things running about on\r\nvarious unknown but evidently serious errands, sometimes carrying tiny\r\nscraps of straw or feather or food, or climbing blades of grass as if\r\nthey were trees from whose tops one could look out to explore the\r\ncountry. A mole throwing up its mound at the end of its burrow and\r\nmaking its way out at last with the long-nailed paws which looked so\r\nlike elfish hands, had absorbed him one whole morning. Ants’ ways,\r\nbeetles’ ways, bees’ ways, frogs’ ways, birds’ ways, plants’ ways, gave\r\nhim a new world to explore and when Dickon revealed them all and added\r\nfoxes’ ways, otters’ ways, ferrets’ ways, squirrels’ ways, and trout’\r\nand water-rats’ and badgers’ ways, there was no end to the things to\r\ntalk about and think over.\r\n\r\nAnd this was not the half of the Magic. The fact that he had really\r\nonce stood on his feet had set Colin thinking tremendously and when\r\nMary told him of the spell she had worked he was excited and approved\r\nof it greatly. He talked of it constantly.\r\n\r\n“Of course there must be lots of Magic in the world,” he said wisely\r\none day, “but people don’t know what it is like or how to make it.\r\nPerhaps the beginning is just to say nice things are going to happen\r\nuntil you make them happen. I am going to try and experiment.”\r\n\r\nThe next morning when they went to the secret garden he sent at once\r\nfor Ben Weatherstaff. Ben came as quickly as he could and found the\r\nRajah standing on his feet under a tree and looking very grand but also\r\nvery beautifully smiling.\r\n\r\n“Good morning, Ben Weatherstaff,” he said. “I want you and Dickon and\r\nMiss Mary to stand in a row and listen to me because I am going to tell\r\nyou something very important.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, aye, sir!” answered Ben Weatherstaff, touching his forehead. (One\r\nof the long concealed charms of Ben Weatherstaff was that in his\r\nboyhood he had once run away to sea and had made voyages. So he could\r\nreply like a sailor.)\r\n\r\n“I am going to try a scientific experiment,” explained the Rajah. “When\r\nI grow up I am going to make great scientific discoveries and I am\r\ngoing to begin now with this experiment.”\r\n\r\n“Aye, aye, sir!” said Ben Weatherstaff promptly, though this was the\r\nfirst time he had heard of great scientific discoveries.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time Mary had heard of them, either, but even at this\r\nstage she had begun to realize that, queer as he was, Colin had read\r\nabout a great many singular things and was somehow a very convincing\r\nsort of boy. When he held up his head and fixed his strange eyes on you\r\nit seemed as if you believed him almost in spite of yourself though he\r\nwas only ten years old—going on eleven. At this moment he was\r\nespecially convincing because he suddenly felt the fascination of\r\nactually making a sort of speech like a grown-up person.\r\n\r\n“The great scientific discoveries I am going to make,” he went on,\r\n“will be about Magic. Magic is a great thing and scarcely anyone knows\r\nanything about it except a few people in old books—and Mary a little,\r\nbecause she was born in India where there are fakirs. I believe Dickon\r\nknows some Magic, but perhaps he doesn’t know he knows it. He charms\r\nanimals and people. I would never have let him come to see me if he had\r\nnot been an animal charmer—which is a boy charmer, too, because a boy\r\nis an animal. I am sure there is Magic in everything, only we have not\r\nsense enough to get hold of it and make it do things for us—like\r\nelectricity and horses and steam.”\r\n\r\nThis sounded so imposing that Ben Weatherstaff became quite excited and\r\nreally could not keep still.\r\n\r\n“Aye, aye, sir,” he said and he began to stand up quite straight.\r\n\r\n“When Mary found this garden it looked quite dead,” the orator\r\nproceeded. “Then something began pushing things up out of the soil and\r\nmaking things out of nothing. One day things weren’t there and another\r\nthey were. I had never watched things before and it made me feel very\r\ncurious. Scientific people are always curious and I am going to be\r\nscientific. I keep saying to myself, ‘What is it? What is it?’ It’s\r\nsomething. It can’t be nothing! I don’t know its name so I call it\r\nMagic. I have never seen the sun rise but Mary and Dickon have and from\r\nwhat they tell me I am sure that is Magic too. Something pushes it up\r\nand draws it. Sometimes since I’ve been in the garden I’ve looked up\r\nthrough the trees at the sky and I have had a strange feeling of being\r\nhappy as if something were pushing and drawing in my chest and making\r\nme breathe fast. Magic is always pushing and drawing and making things\r\nout of nothing. Everything is made out of Magic, leaves and trees,\r\nflowers and birds, badgers and foxes and squirrels and people. So it\r\nmust be all around us. In this garden—in all the places. The Magic in\r\nthis garden has made me stand up and know I am going to live to be a\r\nman. I am going to make the scientific experiment of trying to get some\r\nand put it in myself and make it push and draw me and make me strong. I\r\ndon’t know how to do it but I think that if you keep thinking about it\r\nand calling it perhaps it will come. Perhaps that is the first baby way\r\nto get it. When I was going to try to stand that first time Mary kept\r\nsaying to herself as fast as she could, ‘You can do it! You can do it!’\r\nand I did. I had to try myself at the same time, of course, but her\r\nMagic helped me—and so did Dickon’s. Every morning and evening and as\r\noften in the daytime as I can remember I am going to say, ‘Magic is in\r\nme! Magic is making me well! I am going to be as strong as Dickon, as\r\nstrong as Dickon!’ And you must all do it, too. That is my experiment\r\nWill you help, Ben Weatherstaff?”\r\n\r\n“Aye, aye, sir!” said Ben Weatherstaff. “Aye, aye!”\r\n\r\n“If you keep doing it every day as regularly as soldiers go through\r\ndrill we shall see what will happen and find out if the experiment\r\nsucceeds. You learn things by saying them over and over and thinking\r\nabout them until they stay in your mind forever and I think it will be\r\nthe same with Magic. If you keep calling it to come to you and help you\r\nit will get to be part of you and it will stay and do things.”\r\n\r\n“I once heard an officer in India tell my mother that there were fakirs\r\nwho said words over and over thousands of times,” said Mary.\r\n\r\n“I’ve heard Jem Fettleworth’s wife say th’ same thing over thousands o’\r\ntimes—callin’ Jem a drunken brute,” said Ben Weatherstaff dryly.\r\n“Summat allus come o’ that, sure enough. He gave her a good hidin’ an’\r\nwent to th’ Blue Lion an’ got as drunk as a lord.”\r\n\r\nColin drew his brows together and thought a few minutes. Then he\r\ncheered up.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said, “you see something did come of it. She used the wrong\r\nMagic until she made him beat her. If she’d used the right Magic and\r\nhad said something nice perhaps he wouldn’t have got as drunk as a lord\r\nand perhaps—perhaps he might have bought her a new bonnet.”\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff chuckled and there was shrewd admiration in his little\r\nold eyes.\r\n\r\n“Tha’rt a clever lad as well as a straight-legged one, Mester Colin,”\r\nhe said. “Next time I see Bess Fettleworth I’ll give her a bit of a\r\nhint o’ what Magic will do for her. She’d be rare an’ pleased if th’\r\nsinetifik ’speriment worked—an’ so ’ud Jem.”\r\n\r\nDickon had stood listening to the lecture, his round eyes shining with\r\ncurious delight. Nut and Shell were on his shoulders and he held a\r\nlong-eared white rabbit in his arm and stroked and stroked it softly\r\nwhile it laid its ears along its back and enjoyed itself.\r\n\r\n“Do you think the experiment will work?” Colin asked him, wondering\r\nwhat he was thinking. He so often wondered what Dickon was thinking\r\nwhen he saw him looking at him or at one of his “creatures” with his\r\nhappy wide smile.\r\n\r\nHe smiled now and his smile was wider than usual.\r\n\r\n“Aye,” he answered, “that I do. It’ll work same as th’ seeds do when\r\nth’ sun shines on ’em. It’ll work for sure. Shall us begin it now?”\r\n\r\nColin was delighted and so was Mary. Fired by recollections of fakirs\r\nand devotees in illustrations Colin suggested that they should all sit\r\ncross-legged under the tree which made a canopy.\r\n\r\n“It will be like sitting in a sort of temple,” said Colin. “I’m rather\r\ntired and I want to sit down.”\r\n\r\n“Eh!” said Dickon, “tha’ mustn’t begin by sayin’ tha’rt tired. Tha’\r\nmight spoil th’ Magic.”\r\n\r\nColin turned and looked at him—into his innocent round eyes.\r\n\r\n“That’s true,” he said slowly. “I must only think of the Magic.”\r\n\r\nIt all seemed most majestic and mysterious when they sat down in their\r\ncircle. Ben Weatherstaff felt as if he had somehow been led into\r\nappearing at a prayer-meeting. Ordinarily he was very fixed in being\r\nwhat he called “agen’ prayer-meetin’s” but this being the Rajah’s\r\naffair he did not resent it and was indeed inclined to be gratified at\r\nbeing called upon to assist. Mistress Mary felt solemnly enraptured.\r\nDickon held his rabbit in his arm, and perhaps he made some charmer’s\r\nsignal no one heard, for when he sat down, cross-legged like the rest,\r\nthe crow, the fox, the squirrels and the lamb slowly drew near and made\r\npart of the circle, settling each into a place of rest as if of their\r\nown desire.\r\n\r\n“The ‘creatures’ have come,” said Colin gravely. “They want to help\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nColin really looked quite beautiful, Mary thought. He held his head\r\nhigh as if he felt like a sort of priest and his strange eyes had a\r\nwonderful look in them. The light shone on him through the tree canopy.\r\n\r\n“Now we will begin,” he said. “Shall we sway backward and forward,\r\nMary, as if we were dervishes?”\r\n\r\n“I canna’ do no swayin’ back’ard and for’ard,” said Ben Weatherstaff.\r\n“I’ve got th’ rheumatics.”\r\n\r\n“The Magic will take them away,” said Colin in a High Priest tone, “but\r\nwe won’t sway until it has done it. We will only chant.”\r\n\r\n“I canna’ do no chantin’” said Ben Weatherstaff a trifle testily. “They\r\nturned me out o’ th’ church choir th’ only time I ever tried it.”\r\n\r\nNo one smiled. They were all too much in earnest. Colin’s face was not\r\neven crossed by a shadow. He was thinking only of the Magic.\r\n\r\n“Then I will chant,” he said. And he began, looking like a strange boy\r\nspirit. “The sun is shining—the sun is shining. That is the Magic. The\r\nflowers are growing—the roots are stirring. That is the Magic. Being\r\nalive is the Magic—being strong is the Magic. The Magic is in me—the\r\nMagic is in me. It is in me—it is in me. It’s in everyone of us. It’s\r\nin Ben Weatherstaff’s back. Magic! Magic! Come and help!”\r\n\r\nHe said it a great many times—not a thousand times but quite a goodly\r\nnumber. Mary listened entranced. She felt as if it were at once queer\r\nand beautiful and she wanted him to go on and on. Ben Weatherstaff\r\nbegan to feel soothed into a sort of dream which was quite agreeable.\r\nThe humming of the bees in the blossoms mingled with the chanting voice\r\nand drowsily melted into a doze. Dickon sat cross-legged with his\r\nrabbit asleep on his arm and a hand resting on the lamb’s back. Soot\r\nhad pushed away a squirrel and huddled close to him on his shoulder,\r\nthe gray film dropped over his eyes. At last Colin stopped.\r\n\r\n“Now I am going to walk round the garden,” he announced.\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff’s head had just dropped forward and he lifted it with\r\na jerk.\r\n\r\n“You have been asleep,” said Colin.\r\n\r\n“Nowt o’ th’ sort,” mumbled Ben. “Th’ sermon was good enow—but I’m\r\nbound to get out afore th’ collection.”\r\n\r\nHe was not quite awake yet.\r\n\r\n“You’re not in church,” said Colin.\r\n\r\n“Not me,” said Ben, straightening himself. “Who said I were? I heard\r\nevery bit of it. You said th’ Magic was in my back. Th’ doctor calls it\r\nrheumatics.”\r\n\r\nThe Rajah waved his hand.\r\n\r\n“That was the wrong Magic,” he said. “You will get better. You have my\r\npermission to go to your work. But come back tomorrow.”\r\n\r\n“I’d like to see thee walk round the garden,” grunted Ben.\r\n\r\nIt was not an unfriendly grunt, but it was a grunt. In fact, being a\r\nstubborn old party and not having entire faith in Magic he had made up\r\nhis mind that if he were sent away he would climb his ladder and look\r\nover the wall so that he might be ready to hobble back if there were\r\nany stumbling.\r\n\r\nThe Rajah did not object to his staying and so the procession was\r\nformed. It really did look like a procession. Colin was at its head\r\nwith Dickon on one side and Mary on the other. Ben Weatherstaff walked\r\nbehind, and the “creatures” trailed after them, the lamb and the fox\r\ncub keeping close to Dickon, the white rabbit hopping along or stopping\r\nto nibble and Soot following with the solemnity of a person who felt\r\nhimself in charge.\r\n\r\nIt was a procession which moved slowly but with dignity. Every few\r\nyards it stopped to rest. Colin leaned on Dickon’s arm and privately\r\nBen Weatherstaff kept a sharp lookout, but now and then Colin took his\r\nhand from its support and walked a few steps alone. His head was held\r\nup all the time and he looked very grand.\r\n\r\n“The Magic is in me!” he kept saying. “The Magic is making me strong! I\r\ncan feel it! I can feel it!”\r\n\r\nIt seemed very certain that something was upholding and uplifting him.\r\nHe sat on the seats in the alcoves, and once or twice he sat down on\r\nthe grass and several times he paused in the path and leaned on Dickon,\r\nbut he would not give up until he had gone all round the garden. When\r\nhe returned to the canopy tree his cheeks were flushed and he looked\r\ntriumphant.\r\n\r\n“I did it! The Magic worked!” he cried. “That is my first scientific\r\ndiscovery.”\r\n\r\n“What will Dr. Craven say?” broke out Mary.\r\n\r\n“He won’t say anything,” Colin answered, “because he will not be told.\r\nThis is to be the biggest secret of all. No one is to know anything\r\nabout it until I have grown so strong that I can walk and run like any\r\nother boy. I shall come here every day in my chair and I shall be taken\r\nback in it. I won’t have people whispering and asking questions and I\r\nwon’t let my father hear about it until the experiment has quite\r\nsucceeded. Then sometime when he comes back to Misselthwaite I shall\r\njust walk into his study and say ‘Here I am; I am like any other boy. I\r\nam quite well and I shall live to be a man. It has been done by a\r\nscientific experiment.’”\r\n\r\n“He will think he is in a dream,” cried Mary. “He won’t believe his\r\neyes.”\r\n\r\nColin flushed triumphantly. He had made himself believe that he was\r\ngoing to get well, which was really more than half the battle, if he\r\nhad been aware of it. And the thought which stimulated him more than\r\nany other was this imagining what his father would look like when he\r\nsaw that he had a son who was as straight and strong as other fathers’\r\nsons. One of his darkest miseries in the unhealthy morbid past days had\r\nbeen his hatred of being a sickly weak-backed boy whose father was\r\nafraid to look at him.\r\n\r\n“He’ll be obliged to believe them,” he said.\r\n\r\n“One of the things I am going to do, after the Magic works and before I\r\nbegin to make scientific discoveries, is to be an athlete.”\r\n\r\n“We shall have thee takin’ to boxin’ in a week or so,” said Ben\r\nWeatherstaff. “Tha’lt end wi’ winnin’ th’ Belt an’ bein’ champion\r\nprize-fighter of all England.”\r\n\r\nColin fixed his eyes on him sternly.\r\n\r\n“Weatherstaff,” he said, “that is disrespectful. You must not take\r\nliberties because you are in the secret. However much the Magic works I\r\nshall not be a prize-fighter. I shall be a Scientific Discoverer.”\r\n\r\n“Ax pardon—ax pardon, sir” answered Ben, touching his forehead in\r\nsalute. “I ought to have seed it wasn’t a jokin’ matter,” but his eyes\r\ntwinkled and secretly he was immensely pleased. He really did not mind\r\nbeing snubbed since the snubbing meant that the lad was gaining\r\nstrength and spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n“LET THEM LAUGH”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe secret garden was not the only one Dickon worked in. Round the\r\ncottage on the moor there was a piece of ground enclosed by a low wall\r\nof rough stones. Early in the morning and late in the fading twilight\r\nand on all the days Colin and Mary did not see him, Dickon worked there\r\nplanting or tending potatoes and cabbages, turnips and carrots and\r\nherbs for his mother. In the company of his “creatures” he did wonders\r\nthere and was never tired of doing them, it seemed. While he dug or\r\nweeded he whistled or sang bits of Yorkshire moor songs or talked to\r\nSoot or Captain or the brothers and sisters he had taught to help him.\r\n\r\n“We’d never get on as comfortable as we do,” Mrs. Sowerby said, “if it\r\nwasn’t for Dickon’s garden. Anything’ll grow for him. His ’taters and\r\ncabbages is twice th’ size of anyone else’s an’ they’ve got a flavor\r\nwith ’em as nobody’s has.”\r\n\r\nWhen she found a moment to spare she liked to go out and talk to him.\r\nAfter supper there was still a long clear twilight to work in and that\r\nwas her quiet time. She could sit upon the low rough wall and look on\r\nand hear stories of the day. She loved this time. There were not only\r\nvegetables in this garden. Dickon had bought penny packages of flower\r\nseeds now and then and sown bright sweet-scented things among\r\ngooseberry bushes and even cabbages and he grew borders of mignonette\r\nand pinks and pansies and things whose seeds he could save year after\r\nyear or whose roots would bloom each spring and spread in time into\r\nfine clumps. The low wall was one of the prettiest things in Yorkshire\r\nbecause he had tucked moorland foxglove and ferns and rock-cress and\r\nhedgerow flowers into every crevice until only here and there glimpses\r\nof the stones were to be seen.\r\n\r\n“All a chap’s got to do to make ’em thrive, mother,” he would say, “is\r\nto be friends with ’em for sure. They’re just like th’ ‘creatures.’ If\r\nthey’re thirsty give ’em drink and if they’re hungry give ’em a bit o’\r\nfood. They want to live same as we do. If they died I should feel as if\r\nI’d been a bad lad and somehow treated them heartless.”\r\n\r\nIt was in these twilight hours that Mrs. Sowerby heard of all that\r\nhappened at Misselthwaite Manor. At first she was only told that\r\n“Mester Colin” had taken a fancy to going out into the grounds with\r\nMiss Mary and that it was doing him good. But it was not long before it\r\nwas agreed between the two children that Dickon’s mother might “come\r\ninto the secret.” Somehow it was not doubted that she was “safe for\r\nsure.”\r\n\r\nSo one beautiful still evening Dickon told the whole story, with all\r\nthe thrilling details of the buried key and the robin and the gray haze\r\nwhich had seemed like deadness and the secret Mistress Mary had planned\r\nnever to reveal. The coming of Dickon and how it had been told to him,\r\nthe doubt of Mester Colin and the final drama of his introduction to\r\nthe hidden domain, combined with the incident of Ben Weatherstaff’s\r\nangry face peering over the wall and Mester Colin’s sudden indignant\r\nstrength, made Mrs. Sowerby’s nice-looking face quite change color\r\nseveral times.\r\n\r\n“My word!” she said. “It was a good thing that little lass came to th’\r\nManor. It’s been th’ makin’ o’ her an’ th’ savin, o’ him. Standin’ on\r\nhis feet! An’ us all thinkin’ he was a poor half-witted lad with not a\r\nstraight bone in him.”\r\n\r\nShe asked a great many questions and her blue eyes were full of deep\r\nthinking.\r\n\r\n“What do they make of it at th’ Manor—him being so well an’ cheerful\r\nan’ never complainin’?” she inquired.\r\n\r\n“They don’t know what to make of it,” answered Dickon. “Every day as\r\ncomes round his face looks different. It’s fillin’ out and doesn’t look\r\nso sharp an’ th’ waxy color is goin’. But he has to do his bit o’\r\ncomplainin’,” with a highly entertained grin.\r\n\r\n“What for, i’ Mercy’s name?” asked Mrs. Sowerby.\r\n\r\nDickon chuckled.\r\n\r\n“He does it to keep them from guessin’ what’s happened. If the doctor\r\nknew he’d found out he could stand on his feet he’d likely write and\r\ntell Mester Craven. Mester Colin’s savin’ th’ secret to tell himself.\r\nHe’s goin’ to practise his Magic on his legs every day till his father\r\ncomes back an’ then he’s goin’ to march into his room an’ show him he’s\r\nas straight as other lads. But him an’ Miss Mary thinks it’s best plan\r\nto do a bit o’ groanin’ an’ frettin’ now an’ then to throw folk off th’\r\nscent.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Sowerby was laughing a low comfortable laugh long before he had\r\nfinished his last sentence.\r\n\r\n“Eh!” she said, “that pair’s enjoyin’ theirselves I’ll warrant. They’ll\r\nget a good bit o’ actin’ out of it an’ there’s nothin’ children likes\r\nas much as play actin’. Let’s hear what they do, Dickon lad.”\r\n\r\nDickon stopped weeding and sat up on his heels to tell her. His eyes\r\nwere twinkling with fun.\r\n\r\n“Mester Colin is carried down to his chair every time he goes out,” he\r\nexplained. “An’ he flies out at John, th’ footman, for not carryin’ him\r\ncareful enough. He makes himself as helpless lookin’ as he can an’\r\nnever lifts his head until we’re out o’ sight o’ th’ house. An’ he\r\ngrunts an’ frets a good bit when he’s bein’ settled into his chair. Him\r\nan’ Miss Mary’s both got to enjoyin’ it an’ when he groans an’\r\ncomplains she’ll say, ‘Poor Colin! Does it hurt you so much? Are you so\r\nweak as that, poor Colin?’—but th’ trouble is that sometimes they can\r\nscarce keep from burstin’ out laughin’. When we get safe into the\r\ngarden they laugh till they’ve no breath left to laugh with. An’ they\r\nhave to stuff their faces into Mester Colin’s cushions to keep the\r\ngardeners from hearin’, if any of, ’em’s about.”\r\n\r\n“Th’ more they laugh th’ better for ’em!” said Mrs. Sowerby, still\r\nlaughing herself. “Good healthy child laughin’s better than pills any\r\nday o’ th’ year. That pair’ll plump up for sure.”\r\n\r\n“They are plumpin’ up,” said Dickon. “They’re that hungry they don’t\r\nknow how to get enough to eat without makin’ talk. Mester Colin says if\r\nhe keeps sendin’ for more food they won’t believe he’s an invalid at\r\nall. Miss Mary says she’ll let him eat her share, but he says that if\r\nshe goes hungry she’ll get thin an’ they mun both get fat at once.”\r\n\r\nMrs. Sowerby laughed so heartily at the revelation of this difficulty\r\nthat she quite rocked backward and forward in her blue cloak, and\r\nDickon laughed with her.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell thee what, lad,” Mrs. Sowerby said when she could speak.\r\n“I’ve thought of a way to help ’em. When tha’ goes to ’em in th’\r\nmornin’s tha’ shall take a pail o’ good new milk an’ I’ll bake ’em a\r\ncrusty cottage loaf or some buns wi’ currants in ’em, same as you\r\nchildren like. Nothin’s so good as fresh milk an’ bread. Then they\r\ncould take off th’ edge o’ their hunger while they were in their garden\r\nan’ th, fine food they get indoors ’ud polish off th’ corners.”\r\n\r\n“Eh! mother!” said Dickon admiringly, “what a wonder tha’ art! Tha’\r\nalways sees a way out o’ things. They was quite in a pother yesterday.\r\nThey didn’t see how they was to manage without orderin’ up more\r\nfood—they felt that empty inside.”\r\n\r\n“They’re two young ’uns growin’ fast, an’ health’s comin’ back to both\r\nof ’em. Children like that feels like young wolves an’ food’s flesh an’\r\nblood to ’em,” said Mrs. Sowerby. Then she smiled Dickon’s own curving\r\nsmile. “Eh! but they’re enjoyin’ theirselves for sure,” she said.\r\n\r\nShe was quite right, the comfortable wonderful mother creature—and she\r\nhad never been more so than when she said their “play actin’” would be\r\ntheir joy. Colin and Mary found it one of their most thrilling sources\r\nof entertainment. The idea of protecting themselves from suspicion had\r\nbeen unconsciously suggested to them first by the puzzled nurse and\r\nthen by Dr. Craven himself.\r\n\r\n“Your appetite. Is improving very much, Master Colin,” the nurse had\r\nsaid one day. “You used to eat nothing, and so many things disagreed\r\nwith you.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing disagrees with me now” replied Colin, and then seeing the\r\nnurse looking at him curiously he suddenly remembered that perhaps he\r\nought not to appear too well just yet. “At least things don’t so often\r\ndisagree with me. It’s the fresh air.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it is,” said the nurse, still looking at him with a mystified\r\nexpression. “But I must talk to Dr. Craven about it.”\r\n\r\n“How she stared at you!” said Mary when she went away. “As if she\r\nthought there must be something to find out.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t have her finding out things,” said Colin. “No one must begin\r\nto find out yet.”\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Craven came that morning he seemed puzzled, also. He asked a\r\nnumber of questions, to Colin’s great annoyance.\r\n\r\n“You stay out in the garden a great deal,” he suggested. “Where do you\r\ngo?”\r\n\r\nColin put on his favorite air of dignified indifference to opinion.\r\n\r\n“I will not let anyone know where I go,” he answered. “I go to a place\r\nI like. Everyone has orders to keep out of the way. I won’t be watched\r\nand stared at. You know that!”\r\n\r\n“You seem to be out all day but I do not think it has done you harm—I\r\ndo not think so. The nurse says that you eat much more than you have\r\never done before.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” said Colin, prompted by a sudden inspiration, “perhaps it is\r\nan unnatural appetite.”\r\n\r\n“I do not think so, as your food seems to agree with you,” said Dr.\r\nCraven. “You are gaining flesh rapidly and your color is better.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps—perhaps I am bloated and feverish,” said Colin, assuming a\r\ndiscouraging air of gloom. “People who are not going to live are\r\noften—different.”\r\n\r\nDr. Craven shook his head. He was holding Colin’s wrist and he pushed\r\nup his sleeve and felt his arm.\r\n\r\n“You are not feverish,” he said thoughtfully, “and such flesh as you\r\nhave gained is healthy. If you can keep this up, my boy, we need not\r\ntalk of dying. Your father will be happy to hear of this remarkable\r\nimprovement.”\r\n\r\n“I won’t have him told!” Colin broke forth fiercely. “It will only\r\ndisappoint him if I get worse again—and I may get worse this very\r\nnight. I might have a raging fever. I feel as if I might be beginning\r\nto have one now. I won’t have letters written to my father—I won’t—I\r\nwon’t! You are making me angry and you know that is bad for me. I feel\r\nhot already. I hate being written about and being talked over as much\r\nas I hate being stared at!”\r\n\r\n“Hush-h! my boy,” Dr. Craven soothed him. “Nothing shall be written\r\nwithout your permission. You are too sensitive about things. You must\r\nnot undo the good which has been done.”\r\n\r\nHe said no more about writing to Mr. Craven and when he saw the nurse\r\nhe privately warned her that such a possibility must not be mentioned\r\nto the patient.\r\n\r\n“The boy is extraordinarily better,” he said. “His advance seems almost\r\nabnormal. But of course he is doing now of his own free will what we\r\ncould not make him do before. Still, he excites himself very easily and\r\nnothing must be said to irritate him.”\r\n\r\nMary and Colin were much alarmed and talked together anxiously. From\r\nthis time dated their plan of “play actin’.”\r\n\r\n“I may be obliged to have a tantrum,” said Colin regretfully. “I don’t\r\nwant to have one and I’m not miserable enough now to work myself into a\r\nbig one. Perhaps I couldn’t have one at all. That lump doesn’t come in\r\nmy throat now and I keep thinking of nice things instead of horrible\r\nones. But if they talk about writing to my father I shall have to do\r\nsomething.”\r\n\r\nHe made up his mind to eat less, but unfortunately it was not possible\r\nto carry out this brilliant idea when he wakened each morning with an\r\namazing appetite and the table near his sofa was set with a breakfast\r\nof home-made bread and fresh butter, snow-white eggs, raspberry jam and\r\nclotted cream. Mary always breakfasted with him and when they found\r\nthemselves at the table—particularly if there were delicate slices of\r\nsizzling ham sending forth tempting odors from under a hot silver\r\ncover—they would look into each other’s eyes in desperation.\r\n\r\n“I think we shall have to eat it all this morning, Mary,” Colin always\r\nended by saying. “We can send away some of the lunch and a great deal\r\nof the dinner.”\r\n\r\nBut they never found they could send away anything and the highly\r\npolished condition of the empty plates returned to the pantry awakened\r\nmuch comment.\r\n\r\n“I do wish,” Colin would say also, “I do wish the slices of ham were\r\nthicker, and one muffin each is not enough for anyone.”\r\n\r\n“It’s enough for a person who is going to die,” answered Mary when\r\nfirst she heard this, “but it’s not enough for a person who is going to\r\nlive. I sometimes feel as if I could eat three when those nice fresh\r\nheather and gorse smells from the moor come pouring in at the open\r\nwindow.”\r\n\r\nThe morning that Dickon—after they had been enjoying themselves in the\r\ngarden for about two hours—went behind a big rosebush and brought forth\r\ntwo tin pails and revealed that one was full of rich new milk with\r\ncream on the top of it, and that the other held cottage-made currant\r\nbuns folded in a clean blue and white napkin, buns so carefully tucked\r\nin that they were still hot, there was a riot of surprised joyfulness.\r\nWhat a wonderful thing for Mrs. Sowerby to think of! What a kind,\r\nclever woman she must be! How good the buns were! And what delicious\r\nfresh milk!\r\n\r\n“Magic is in her just as it is in Dickon,” said Colin. “It makes her\r\nthink of ways to do things—nice things. She is a Magic person. Tell her\r\nwe are grateful, Dickon—extremely grateful.”\r\n\r\nHe was given to using rather grown-up phrases at times. He enjoyed\r\nthem. He liked this so much that he improved upon it.\r\n\r\n“Tell her she has been most bounteous and our gratitude is extreme.”\r\n\r\nAnd then forgetting his grandeur he fell to and stuffed himself with\r\nbuns and drank milk out of the pail in copious draughts in the manner\r\nof any hungry little boy who had been taking unusual exercise and\r\nbreathing in moorland air and whose breakfast was more than two hours\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nThis was the beginning of many agreeable incidents of the same kind.\r\nThey actually awoke to the fact that as Mrs. Sowerby had fourteen\r\npeople to provide food for she might not have enough to satisfy two\r\nextra appetites every day. So they asked her to let them send some of\r\ntheir shillings to buy things.\r\n\r\nDickon made the stimulating discovery that in the wood in the park\r\noutside the garden where Mary had first found him piping to the wild\r\ncreatures there was a deep little hollow where you could build a sort\r\nof tiny oven with stones and roast potatoes and eggs in it. Roasted\r\neggs were a previously unknown luxury and very hot potatoes with salt\r\nand fresh butter in them were fit for a woodland king—besides being\r\ndeliciously satisfying. You could buy both potatoes and eggs and eat as\r\nmany as you liked without feeling as if you were taking food out of the\r\nmouths of fourteen people.\r\n\r\nEvery beautiful morning the Magic was worked by the mystic circle under\r\nthe plum-tree which provided a canopy of thickening green leaves after\r\nits brief blossom-time was ended. After the ceremony Colin always took\r\nhis walking exercise and throughout the day he exercised his newly\r\nfound power at intervals. Each day he grew stronger and could walk more\r\nsteadily and cover more ground. And each day his belief in the Magic\r\ngrew stronger—as well it might. He tried one experiment after another\r\nas he felt himself gaining strength and it was Dickon who showed him\r\nthe best things of all.\r\n\r\n“Yesterday,” he said one morning after an absence, “I went to Thwaite\r\nfor mother an’ near th’ Blue Cow Inn I seed Bob Haworth. He’s the\r\nstrongest chap on th’ moor. He’s the champion wrestler an’ he can jump\r\nhigher than any other chap an’ throw th’ hammer farther. He’s gone all\r\nth’ way to Scotland for th’ sports some years. He’s knowed me ever\r\nsince I was a little ’un an’ he’s a friendly sort an’ I axed him some\r\nquestions. Th’ gentry calls him a athlete and I thought o’ thee, Mester\r\nColin, and I says, ‘How did tha’ make tha’ muscles stick out that way,\r\nBob? Did tha’ do anythin’ extra to make thysel’ so strong?’ An’ he says\r\n‘Well, yes, lad, I did. A strong man in a show that came to Thwaite\r\nonce showed me how to exercise my arms an’ legs an’ every muscle in my\r\nbody. An’ I says, ‘Could a delicate chap make himself stronger with\r\n’em, Bob?’ an’ he laughed an’ says, ‘Art tha’ th’ delicate chap?’ an’ I\r\nsays, ‘No, but I knows a young gentleman that’s gettin’ well of a long\r\nillness an’ I wish I knowed some o’ them tricks to tell him about.’ I\r\ndidn’t say no names an’ he didn’t ask none. He’s friendly same as I\r\nsaid an’ he stood up an’ showed me good-natured like, an’ I imitated\r\nwhat he did till I knowed it by heart.”\r\n\r\nColin had been listening excitedly.\r\n\r\n“Can you show me?” he cried. “Will you?”\r\n\r\n“Aye, to be sure,” Dickon answered, getting up. “But he says tha’ mun\r\ndo ’em gentle at first an’ be careful not to tire thysel’. Rest in\r\nbetween times an’ take deep breaths an’ don’t overdo.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be careful,” said Colin. “Show me! Show me! Dickon, you are the\r\nmost Magic boy in the world!”\r\n\r\nDickon stood up on the grass and slowly went through a carefully\r\npractical but simple series of muscle exercises. Colin watched them\r\nwith widening eyes. He could do a few while he was sitting down.\r\nPresently he did a few gently while he stood upon his already steadied\r\nfeet. Mary began to do them also. Soot, who was watching the\r\nperformance, became much disturbed and left his branch and hopped about\r\nrestlessly because he could not do them too.\r\n\r\nFrom that time the exercises were part of the day’s duties as much as\r\nthe Magic was. It became possible for both Colin and Mary to do more of\r\nthem each time they tried, and such appetites were the results that but\r\nfor the basket Dickon put down behind the bush each morning when he\r\narrived they would have been lost. But the little oven in the hollow\r\nand Mrs. Sowerby’s bounties were so satisfying that Mrs. Medlock and\r\nthe nurse and Dr. Craven became mystified again. You can trifle with\r\nyour breakfast and seem to disdain your dinner if you are full to the\r\nbrim with roasted eggs and potatoes and richly frothed new milk and\r\noatcakes and buns and heather honey and clotted cream.\r\n\r\n“They are eating next to nothing,” said the nurse. “They’ll die of\r\nstarvation if they can’t be persuaded to take some nourishment. And yet\r\nsee how they look.”\r\n\r\n“Look!” exclaimed Mrs. Medlock indignantly. “Eh! I’m moithered to death\r\nwith them. They’re a pair of young Satans. Bursting their jackets one\r\nday and the next turning up their noses at the best meals Cook can\r\ntempt them with. Not a mouthful of that lovely young fowl and bread\r\nsauce did they set a fork into yesterday—and the poor woman fair\r\n_invented_ a pudding for them—and back it’s sent. She almost cried.\r\nShe’s afraid she’ll be blamed if they starve themselves into their\r\ngraves.”\r\n\r\nDr. Craven came and looked at Colin long and carefully, He wore an\r\nextremely worried expression when the nurse talked with him and showed\r\nhim the almost untouched tray of breakfast she had saved for him to\r\nlook at—but it was even more worried when he sat down by Colin’s sofa\r\nand examined him. He had been called to London on business and had not\r\nseen the boy for nearly two weeks. When young things begin to gain\r\nhealth they gain it rapidly. The waxen tinge had left, Colins skin and\r\na warm rose showed through it; his beautiful eyes were clear and the\r\nhollows under them and in his cheeks and temples had filled out. His\r\nonce dark, heavy locks had begun to look as if they sprang healthily\r\nfrom his forehead and were soft and warm with life. His lips were\r\nfuller and of a normal color. In fact as an imitation of a boy who was\r\na confirmed invalid he was a disgraceful sight. Dr. Craven held his\r\nchin in his hand and thought him over.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry to hear that you do not eat anything,” he said. “That will\r\nnot do. You will lose all you have gained—and you have gained\r\namazingly. You ate so well a short time ago.”\r\n\r\n“I told you it was an unnatural appetite,” answered Colin.\r\n\r\nMary was sitting on her stool nearby and she suddenly made a very queer\r\nsound which she tried so violently to repress that she ended by almost\r\nchoking.\r\n\r\n“What is the matter?” said Dr. Craven, turning to look at her.\r\n\r\nMary became quite severe in her manner.\r\n\r\n“It was something between a sneeze and a cough,” she replied with\r\nreproachful dignity, “and it got into my throat.”\r\n\r\n“But,” she said afterward to Colin, “I couldn’t stop myself. It just\r\nburst out because all at once I couldn’t help remembering that last big\r\npotato you ate and the way your mouth stretched when you bit through\r\nthat thick lovely crust with jam and clotted cream on it.”\r\n\r\n“Is there any way in which those children can get food secretly?” Dr.\r\nCraven inquired of Mrs. Medlock.\r\n\r\n“There’s no way unless they dig it out of the earth or pick it off the\r\ntrees,” Mrs. Medlock answered. “They stay out in the grounds all day\r\nand see no one but each other. And if they want anything different to\r\neat from what’s sent up to them they need only ask for it.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Dr. Craven, “so long as going without food agrees with\r\nthem we need not disturb ourselves. The boy is a new creature.”\r\n\r\n“So is the girl,” said Mrs. Medlock. “She’s begun to be downright\r\npretty since she’s filled out and lost her ugly little sour look. Her\r\nhair’s grown thick and healthy looking and she’s got a bright color.\r\nThe glummest, ill-natured little thing she used to be and now her and\r\nMaster Colin laugh together like a pair of crazy young ones. Perhaps\r\nthey’re growing fat on that.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps they are,” said Dr. Craven. “Let them laugh.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\nTHE CURTAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the secret garden bloomed and bloomed and every morning revealed\r\nnew miracles. In the robin’s nest there were Eggs and the robin’s mate\r\nsat upon them keeping them warm with her feathery little breast and\r\ncareful wings. At first she was very nervous and the robin himself was\r\nindignantly watchful. Even Dickon did not go near the close-grown\r\ncorner in those days, but waited until by the quiet working of some\r\nmysterious spell he seemed to have conveyed to the soul of the little\r\npair that in the garden there was nothing which was not quite like\r\nthemselves—nothing which did not understand the wonderfulness of what\r\nwas happening to them—the immense, tender, terrible, heart-breaking\r\nbeauty and solemnity of Eggs. If there had been one person in that\r\ngarden who had not known through all his or her innermost being that if\r\nan Egg were taken away or hurt the whole world would whirl round and\r\ncrash through space and come to an end—if there had been even one who\r\ndid not feel it and act accordingly there could have been no happiness\r\neven in that golden springtime air. But they all knew it and felt it\r\nand the robin and his mate knew they knew it.\r\n\r\nAt first the robin watched Mary and Colin with sharp anxiety. For some\r\nmysterious reason he knew he need not watch Dickon. The first moment he\r\nset his dew-bright black eye on Dickon he knew he was not a stranger\r\nbut a sort of robin without beak or feathers. He could speak robin\r\n(which is a quite distinct language not to be mistaken for any other).\r\nTo speak robin to a robin is like speaking French to a Frenchman.\r\nDickon always spoke it to the robin himself, so the queer gibberish he\r\nused when he spoke to humans did not matter in the least. The robin\r\nthought he spoke this gibberish to them because they were not\r\nintelligent enough to understand feathered speech. His movements also\r\nwere robin. They never startled one by being sudden enough to seem\r\ndangerous or threatening. Any robin could understand Dickon, so his\r\npresence was not even disturbing.\r\n\r\nBut at the outset it seemed necessary to be on guard against the other\r\ntwo. In the first place the boy creature did not come into the garden\r\non his legs. He was pushed in on a thing with wheels and the skins of\r\nwild animals were thrown over him. That in itself was doubtful. Then\r\nwhen he began to stand up and move about he did it in a queer\r\nunaccustomed way and the others seemed to have to help him. The robin\r\nused to secrete himself in a bush and watch this anxiously, his head\r\ntilted first on one side and then on the other. He thought that the\r\nslow movements might mean that he was preparing to pounce, as cats do.\r\nWhen cats are preparing to pounce they creep over the ground very\r\nslowly. The robin talked this over with his mate a great deal for a few\r\ndays but after that he decided not to speak of the subject because her\r\nterror was so great that he was afraid it might be injurious to the\r\nEggs.\r\n\r\nWhen the boy began to walk by himself and even to move more quickly it\r\nwas an immense relief. But for a long time—or it seemed a long time to\r\nthe robin—he was a source of some anxiety. He did not act as the other\r\nhumans did. He seemed very fond of walking but he had a way of sitting\r\nor lying down for a while and then getting up in a disconcerting manner\r\nto begin again.\r\n\r\nOne day the robin remembered that when he himself had been made to\r\nlearn to fly by his parents he had done much the same sort of thing. He\r\nhad taken short flights of a few yards and then had been obliged to\r\nrest. So it occurred to him that this boy was learning to fly—or rather\r\nto walk. He mentioned this to his mate and when he told her that the\r\nEggs would probably conduct themselves in the same way after they were\r\nfledged she was quite comforted and even became eagerly interested and\r\nderived great pleasure from watching the boy over the edge of her\r\nnest—though she always thought that the Eggs would be much cleverer and\r\nlearn more quickly. But then she said indulgently that humans were\r\nalways more clumsy and slow than Eggs and most of them never seemed\r\nreally to learn to fly at all. You never met them in the air or on\r\ntree-tops.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the boy began to move about as the others did, but all\r\nthree of the children at times did unusual things. They would stand\r\nunder the trees and move their arms and legs and heads about in a way\r\nwhich was neither walking nor running nor sitting down. They went\r\nthrough these movements at intervals every day and the robin was never\r\nable to explain to his mate what they were doing or tying to do. He\r\ncould only say that he was sure that the Eggs would never flap about in\r\nsuch a manner; but as the boy who could speak robin so fluently was\r\ndoing the thing with them, birds could be quite sure that the actions\r\nwere not of a dangerous nature. Of course neither the robin nor his\r\nmate had ever heard of the champion wrestler, Bob Haworth, and his\r\nexercises for making the muscles stand out like lumps. Robins are not\r\nlike human beings; their muscles are always exercised from the first\r\nand so they develop themselves in a natural manner. If you have to fly\r\nabout to find every meal you eat, your muscles do not become atrophied\r\n(atrophied means wasted away through want of use).\r\n\r\nWhen the boy was walking and running about and digging and weeding like\r\nthe others, the nest in the corner was brooded over by a great peace\r\nand content. Fears for the Eggs became things of the past. Knowing that\r\nyour Eggs were as safe as if they were locked in a bank vault and the\r\nfact that you could watch so many curious things going on made setting\r\na most entertaining occupation. On wet days the Eggs’ mother sometimes\r\nfelt even a little dull because the children did not come into the\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nBut even on wet days it could not be said that Mary and Colin were\r\ndull. One morning when the rain streamed down unceasingly and Colin was\r\nbeginning to feel a little restive, as he was obliged to remain on his\r\nsofa because it was not safe to get up and walk about, Mary had an\r\ninspiration.\r\n\r\n“Now that I am a real boy,” Colin had said, “my legs and arms and all\r\nmy body are so full of Magic that I can’t keep them still. They want to\r\nbe doing things all the time. Do you know that when I waken in the\r\nmorning, Mary, when it’s quite early and the birds are just shouting\r\noutside and everything seems just shouting for joy—even the trees and\r\nthings we can’t really hear—I feel as if I must jump out of bed and\r\nshout myself. If I did it, just think what would happen!”\r\n\r\nMary giggled inordinately.\r\n\r\n“The nurse would come running and Mrs. Medlock would come running and\r\nthey would be sure you had gone crazy and they’d send for the doctor,”\r\nshe said.\r\n\r\nColin giggled himself. He could see how they would all look—how\r\nhorrified by his outbreak and how amazed to see him standing upright.\r\n\r\n“I wish my father would come home,” he said. “I want to tell him\r\nmyself. I’m always thinking about it—but we couldn’t go on like this\r\nmuch longer. I can’t stand lying still and pretending, and besides I\r\nlook too different. I wish it wasn’t raining today.”\r\n\r\nIt was then Mistress Mary had her inspiration.\r\n\r\n“Colin,” she began mysteriously, “do you know how many rooms there are\r\nin this house?”\r\n\r\n“About a thousand, I suppose,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“There’s about a hundred no one ever goes into,” said Mary. “And one\r\nrainy day I went and looked into ever so many of them. No one ever\r\nknew, though Mrs. Medlock nearly found me out. I lost my way when I was\r\ncoming back and I stopped at the end of your corridor. That was the\r\nsecond time I heard you crying.”\r\n\r\nColin started up on his sofa.\r\n\r\n“A hundred rooms no one goes into,” he said. “It sounds almost like a\r\nsecret garden. Suppose we go and look at them. Wheel me in my chair and\r\nnobody would know we went.”\r\n\r\n“That’s what I was thinking,” said Mary. “No one would dare to follow\r\nus. There are galleries where you could run. We could do our exercises.\r\nThere is a little Indian room where there is a cabinet full of ivory\r\nelephants. There are all sorts of rooms.”\r\n\r\n“Ring the bell,” said Colin.\r\n\r\nWhen the nurse came in he gave his orders.\r\n\r\n“I want my chair,” he said. “Miss Mary and I are going to look at the\r\npart of the house which is not used. John can push me as far as the\r\npicture-gallery because there are some stairs. Then he must go away and\r\nleave us alone until I send for him again.”\r\n\r\nRainy days lost their terrors that morning. When the footman had\r\nwheeled the chair into the picture-gallery and left the two together in\r\nobedience to orders, Colin and Mary looked at each other delighted. As\r\nsoon as Mary had made sure that John was really on his way back to his\r\nown quarters below stairs, Colin got out of his chair.\r\n\r\n“I am going to run from one end of the gallery to the other,” he said,\r\n“and then I am going to jump and then we will do Bob Haworth’s\r\nexercises.”\r\n\r\nAnd they did all these things and many others. They looked at the\r\nportraits and found the plain little girl dressed in green brocade and\r\nholding the parrot on her finger.\r\n\r\n“All these,” said Colin, “must be my relations. They lived a long time\r\nago. That parrot one, I believe, is one of my great, great, great,\r\ngreat aunts. She looks rather like you, Mary—not as you look now but as\r\nyou looked when you came here. Now you are a great deal fatter and\r\nbetter looking.”\r\n\r\n“So are you,” said Mary, and they both laughed.\r\n\r\nThey went to the Indian room and amused themselves with the ivory\r\nelephants. They found the rose-colored brocade boudoir and the hole in\r\nthe cushion the mouse had left, but the mice had grown up and run away\r\nand the hole was empty. They saw more rooms and made more discoveries\r\nthan Mary had made on her first pilgrimage. They found new corridors\r\nand corners and flights of steps and new old pictures they liked and\r\nweird old things they did not know the use of. It was a curiously\r\nentertaining morning and the feeling of wandering about in the same\r\nhouse with other people but at the same time feeling as if one were\r\nmiles away from them was a fascinating thing.\r\n\r\n“I’m glad we came,” Colin said. “I never knew I lived in such a big\r\nqueer old place. I like it. We will ramble about every rainy day. We\r\nshall always be finding new queer corners and things.”\r\n\r\nThat morning they had found among other things such good appetites that\r\nwhen they returned to Colin’s room it was not possible to send the\r\nluncheon away untouched.\r\n\r\nWhen the nurse carried the tray downstairs she slapped it down on the\r\nkitchen dresser so that Mrs. Loomis, the cook, could see the highly\r\npolished dishes and plates.\r\n\r\n“Look at that!” she said. “This is a house of mystery, and those two\r\nchildren are the greatest mysteries in it.”\r\n\r\n“If they keep that up every day,” said the strong young footman John,\r\n“there’d be small wonder that he weighs twice as much today as he did a\r\nmonth ago. I should have to give up my place in time, for fear of doing\r\nmy muscles an injury.”\r\n\r\nThat afternoon Mary noticed that something new had happened in Colin’s\r\nroom. She had noticed it the day before but had said nothing because\r\nshe thought the change might have been made by chance. She said nothing\r\ntoday but she sat and looked fixedly at the picture over the mantel.\r\nShe could look at it because the curtain had been drawn aside. That was\r\nthe change she noticed.\r\n\r\n“I know what you want me to tell you,” said Colin, after she had stared\r\na few minutes. “I always know when you want me to tell you something.\r\nYou are wondering why the curtain is drawn back. I am going to keep it\r\nlike that.”\r\n\r\n“Why?” asked Mary.\r\n\r\n“Because it doesn’t make me angry any more to see her laughing. I\r\nwakened when it was bright moonlight two nights ago and felt as if the\r\nMagic was filling the room and making everything so splendid that I\r\ncouldn’t lie still. I got up and looked out of the window. The room was\r\nquite light and there was a patch of moonlight on the curtain and\r\nsomehow that made me go and pull the cord. She looked right down at me\r\nas if she were laughing because she was glad I was standing there. It\r\nmade me like to look at her. I want to see her laughing like that all\r\nthe time. I think she must have been a sort of Magic person perhaps.”\r\n\r\n“You are so like her now,” said Mary, “that sometimes I think perhaps\r\nyou are her ghost made into a boy.”\r\n\r\nThat idea seemed to impress Colin. He thought it over and then answered\r\nher slowly.\r\n\r\n“If I were her ghost—my father would be fond of me,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Do you want him to be fond of you?” inquired Mary.\r\n\r\n“I used to hate it because he was not fond of me. If he grew fond of me\r\nI think I should tell him about the Magic. It might make him more\r\ncheerful.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n“IT’S MOTHER!”\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir belief in the Magic was an abiding thing. After the morning’s\r\nincantations Colin sometimes gave them Magic lectures.\r\n\r\n“I like to do it,” he explained, “because when I grow up and make great\r\nscientific discoveries I shall be obliged to lecture about them and so\r\nthis is practise. I can only give short lectures now because I am very\r\nyoung, and besides Ben Weatherstaff would feel as if he were in church\r\nand he would go to sleep.”\r\n\r\n“Th’ best thing about lecturin’,” said Ben, “is that a chap can get up\r\nan’ say aught he pleases an’ no other chap can answer him back. I\r\nwouldn’t be agen’ lecturin’ a bit mysel’ sometimes.”\r\n\r\nBut when Colin held forth under his tree old Ben fixed devouring eyes\r\non him and kept them there. He looked him over with critical affection.\r\nIt was not so much the lecture which interested him as the legs which\r\nlooked straighter and stronger each day, the boyish head which held\r\nitself up so well, the once sharp chin and hollow cheeks which had\r\nfilled and rounded out and the eyes which had begun to hold the light\r\nhe remembered in another pair. Sometimes when Colin felt Ben’s earnest\r\ngaze meant that he was much impressed he wondered what he was\r\nreflecting on and once when he had seemed quite entranced he questioned\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“What are you thinking about, Ben Weatherstaff?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“I was thinkin’” answered Ben, “as I’d warrant tha’s gone up three or\r\nfour pound this week. I was lookin’ at tha’ calves an’ tha’ shoulders.\r\nI’d like to get thee on a pair o’ scales.”\r\n\r\n“It’s the Magic and—and Mrs. Sowerby’s buns and milk and things,” said\r\nColin. “You see the scientific experiment has succeeded.”\r\n\r\nThat morning Dickon was too late to hear the lecture. When he came he\r\nwas ruddy with running and his funny face looked more twinkling than\r\nusual. As they had a good deal of weeding to do after the rains they\r\nfell to work. They always had plenty to do after a warm deep sinking\r\nrain. The moisture which was good for the flowers was also good for the\r\nweeds which thrust up tiny blades of grass and points of leaves which\r\nmust be pulled up before their roots took too firm hold. Colin was as\r\ngood at weeding as anyone in these days and he could lecture while he\r\nwas doing it.\r\n\r\n“The Magic works best when you work, yourself,” he said this morning.\r\n“You can feel it in your bones and muscles. I am going to read books\r\nabout bones and muscles, but I am going to write a book about Magic. I\r\nam making it up now. I keep finding out things.”\r\n\r\nIt was not very long after he had said this that he laid down his\r\ntrowel and stood up on his feet. He had been silent for several minutes\r\nand they had seen that he was thinking out lectures, as he often did.\r\nWhen he dropped his trowel and stood upright it seemed to Mary and\r\nDickon as if a sudden strong thought had made him do it. He stretched\r\nhimself out to his tallest height and he threw out his arms exultantly.\r\nColor glowed in his face and his strange eyes widened with joyfulness.\r\nAll at once he had realized something to the full.\r\n\r\n“Mary! Dickon!” he cried. “Just look at me!”\r\n\r\nThey stopped their weeding and looked at him.\r\n\r\n“Do you remember that first morning you brought me in here?” he\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nDickon was looking at him very hard. Being an animal charmer he could\r\nsee more things than most people could and many of them were things he\r\nnever talked about. He saw some of them now in this boy.\r\n\r\n“Aye, that we do,” he answered.\r\n\r\nMary looked hard too, but she said nothing.\r\n\r\n“Just this minute,” said Colin, “all at once I remembered it\r\nmyself—when I looked at my hand digging with the trowel—and I had to\r\nstand up on my feet to see if it was real. And it is real! I’m\r\n_well_—I’m _well!_”\r\n\r\n“Aye, that th’ art!” said Dickon.\r\n\r\n“I’m well! I’m well!” said Colin again, and his face went quite red all\r\nover.\r\n\r\nHe had known it before in a way, he had hoped it and felt it and\r\nthought about it, but just at that minute something had rushed all\r\nthrough him—a sort of rapturous belief and realization and it had been\r\nso strong that he could not help calling out.\r\n\r\n“I shall live forever and ever and ever!” he cried grandly. “I shall\r\nfind out thousands and thousands of things. I shall find out about\r\npeople and creatures and everything that grows—like Dickon—and I shall\r\nnever stop making Magic. I’m well! I’m well! I feel—I feel as if I want\r\nto shout out something—something thankful, joyful!”\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff, who had been working near a rose-bush, glanced round\r\nat him.\r\n\r\n“Tha’ might sing th’ Doxology,” he suggested in his dryest grunt. He\r\nhad no opinion of the Doxology and he did not make the suggestion with\r\nany particular reverence.\r\n\r\nBut Colin was of an exploring mind and he knew nothing about the\r\nDoxology.\r\n\r\n“What is that?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Dickon can sing it for thee, I’ll warrant,” replied Ben Weatherstaff.\r\n\r\nDickon answered with his all-perceiving animal charmer’s smile.\r\n\r\n“They sing it i’ church,” he said. “Mother says she believes th’\r\nskylarks sings it when they gets up i’ th’ mornin’.”\r\n\r\n“If she says that, it must be a nice song,” Colin answered. “I’ve never\r\nbeen in a church myself. I was always too ill. Sing it, Dickon. I want\r\nto hear it.”\r\n\r\nDickon was quite simple and unaffected about it. He understood what\r\nColin felt better than Colin did himself. He understood by a sort of\r\ninstinct so natural that he did not know it was understanding. He\r\npulled off his cap and looked round still smiling.\r\n\r\n“Tha’ must take off tha’ cap,” he said to Colin, “an’ so mun tha’,\r\nBen—an’ tha’ mun stand up, tha’ knows.”\r\n\r\nColin took off his cap and the sun shone on and warmed his thick hair\r\nas he watched Dickon intently. Ben Weatherstaff scrambled up from his\r\nknees and bared his head too with a sort of puzzled half-resentful look\r\non his old face as if he didn’t know exactly why he was doing this\r\nremarkable thing.\r\n\r\nDickon stood out among the trees and rose-bushes and began to sing in\r\nquite a simple matter-of-fact way and in a nice strong boy voice:\r\n\r\n“Praise God from whom all blessings flow,\r\nPraise Him all creatures here below,\r\nPraise Him above ye Heavenly Host,\r\nPraise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\r\n            Amen.”\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished, Ben Weatherstaff was standing quite still with\r\nhis jaws set obstinately but with a disturbed look in his eyes fixed on\r\nColin. Colin’s face was thoughtful and appreciative.\r\n\r\n“It is a very nice song,” he said. “I like it. Perhaps it means just\r\nwhat I mean when I want to shout out that I am thankful to the Magic.”\r\nHe stopped and thought in a puzzled way. “Perhaps they are both the\r\nsame thing. How can we know the exact names of everything? Sing it\r\nagain, Dickon. Let us try, Mary. I want to sing it, too. It’s my song.\r\nHow does it begin? ‘Praise God from whom all blessings flow’?”\r\n\r\nAnd they sang it again, and Mary and Colin lifted their voices as\r\nmusically as they could and Dickon’s swelled quite loud and\r\nbeautiful—and at the second line Ben Weatherstaff raspingly cleared his\r\nthroat and at the third line he joined in with such vigor that it\r\nseemed almost savage and when the “Amen” came to an end Mary observed\r\nthat the very same thing had happened to him which had happened when he\r\nfound out that Colin was not a cripple—his chin was twitching and he\r\nwas staring and winking and his leathery old cheeks were wet.\r\n\r\n“I never seed no sense in th’ Doxology afore,” he said hoarsely, “but I\r\nmay change my mind i’ time. I should say tha’d gone up five pound this\r\nweek Mester Colin—five on ’em!”\r\n\r\nColin was looking across the garden at something attracting his\r\nattention and his expression had become a startled one.\r\n\r\n“Who is coming in here?” he said quickly. “Who is it?”\r\n\r\nThe door in the ivied wall had been pushed gently open and a woman had\r\nentered. She had come in with the last line of their song and she had\r\nstood still listening and looking at them. With the ivy behind her, the\r\nsunlight drifting through the trees and dappling her long blue cloak,\r\nand her nice fresh face smiling across the greenery she was rather like\r\na softly colored illustration in one of Colin’s books. She had\r\nwonderful affectionate eyes which seemed to take everything in—all of\r\nthem, even Ben Weatherstaff and the “creatures” and every flower that\r\nwas in bloom. Unexpectedly as she had appeared, not one of them felt\r\nthat she was an intruder at all. Dickon’s eyes lighted like lamps.\r\n\r\n“It’s mother—that’s who it is!” he cried and went across the grass at a\r\nrun.\r\n\r\nColin began to move toward her, too, and Mary went with him. They both\r\nfelt their pulses beat faster.\r\n\r\n“It’s mother!” Dickon said again when they met halfway. “I knowed tha’\r\nwanted to see her an’ I told her where th’ door was hid.”\r\n\r\nColin held out his hand with a sort of flushed royal shyness but his\r\neyes quite devoured her face.\r\n\r\n“Even when I was ill I wanted to see you,” he said, “you and Dickon and\r\nthe secret garden. I’d never wanted to see anyone or anything before.”\r\n\r\nThe sight of his uplifted face brought about a sudden change in her\r\nown. She flushed and the corners of her mouth shook and a mist seemed\r\nto sweep over her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Eh! dear lad!” she broke out tremulously. “Eh! dear lad!” as if she\r\nhad not known she were going to say it. She did not say, “Mester\r\nColin,” but just “dear lad” quite suddenly. She might have said it to\r\nDickon in the same way if she had seen something in his face which\r\ntouched her. Colin liked it.\r\n\r\n“Are you surprised because I am so well?” he asked.\r\n\r\nShe put her hand on his shoulder and smiled the mist out of her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Aye, that I am!” she said; “but tha’rt so like thy mother tha’ made my\r\nheart jump.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think,” said Colin a little awkwardly, “that will make my\r\nfather like me?”\r\n\r\n“Aye, for sure, dear lad,” she answered and she gave his shoulder a\r\nsoft quick pat. “He mun come home—he mun come home.”\r\n\r\n“Susan Sowerby,” said Ben Weatherstaff, getting close to her. “Look at\r\nth’ lad’s legs, wilt tha’? They was like drumsticks i’ stockin’ two\r\nmonth’ ago—an’ I heard folk tell as they was bandy an’ knock-kneed both\r\nat th’ same time. Look at ’em now!”\r\n\r\nSusan Sowerby laughed a comfortable laugh.\r\n\r\n“They’re goin’ to be fine strong lad’s legs in a bit,” she said. “Let\r\nhim go on playin’ an’ workin’ in the garden an’ eatin’ hearty an’\r\ndrinkin’ plenty o’ good sweet milk an’ there’ll not be a finer pair i’\r\nYorkshire, thank God for it.”\r\n\r\nShe put both hands on Mistress Mary’s shoulders and looked her little\r\nface over in a motherly fashion.\r\n\r\n“An’ thee, too!” she said. “Tha’rt grown near as hearty as our\r\n’Lisabeth Ellen. I’ll warrant tha’rt like thy mother too. Our Martha\r\ntold me as Mrs. Medlock heard she was a pretty woman. Tha’lt be like a\r\nblush rose when tha’ grows up, my little lass, bless thee.”\r\n\r\nShe did not mention that when Martha came home on her “day out” and\r\ndescribed the plain sallow child she had said that she had no\r\nconfidence whatever in what Mrs. Medlock had heard. “It doesn’t stand\r\nto reason that a pretty woman could be th’ mother o’ such a fou’ little\r\nlass,” she had added obstinately.\r\n\r\nMary had not had time to pay much attention to her changing face. She\r\nhad only known that she looked “different” and seemed to have a great\r\ndeal more hair and that it was growing very fast. But remembering her\r\npleasure in looking at the Mem Sahib in the past she was glad to hear\r\nthat she might some day look like her.\r\n\r\nSusan Sowerby went round their garden with them and was told the whole\r\nstory of it and shown every bush and tree which had come alive. Colin\r\nwalked on one side of her and Mary on the other. Each of them kept\r\nlooking up at her comfortable rosy face, secretly curious about the\r\ndelightful feeling she gave them—a sort of warm, supported feeling. It\r\nseemed as if she understood them as Dickon understood his “creatures.”\r\nShe stooped over the flowers and talked about them as if they were\r\nchildren. Soot followed her and once or twice cawed at her and flew\r\nupon her shoulder as if it were Dickon’s. When they told her about the\r\nrobin and the first flight of the young ones she laughed a motherly\r\nlittle mellow laugh in her throat.\r\n\r\n“I suppose learnin’ ’em to fly is like learnin’ children to walk, but\r\nI’m feared I should be all in a worrit if mine had wings instead o’\r\nlegs,” she said.\r\n\r\nIt was because she seemed such a wonderful woman in her nice moorland\r\ncottage way that at last she was told about the Magic.\r\n\r\n“Do you believe in Magic?” asked Colin after he had explained about\r\nIndian fakirs. “I do hope you do.”\r\n\r\n“That I do, lad,” she answered. “I never knowed it by that name but\r\nwhat does th’ name matter? I warrant they call it a different name i’\r\nFrance an’ a different one i’ Germany. Th’ same thing as set th’ seeds\r\nswellin’ an’ th’ sun shinin’ made thee a well lad an’ it’s th’ Good\r\nThing. It isn’t like us poor fools as think it matters if us is called\r\nout of our names. Th’ Big Good Thing doesn’t stop to worrit, bless\r\nthee. It goes on makin’ worlds by th’ million—worlds like us. Never\r\nthee stop believin’ in th’ Big Good Thing an’ knowin’ th’ world’s full\r\nof it—an’ call it what tha’ likes. Tha’ wert singin’ to it when I come\r\ninto th’ garden.”\r\n\r\n“I felt so joyful,” said Colin, opening his beautiful strange eyes at\r\nher. “Suddenly I felt how different I was—how strong my arms and legs\r\nwere, you know—and how I could dig and stand—and I jumped up and wanted\r\nto shout out something to anything that would listen.”\r\n\r\n“Th’ Magic listened when tha’ sung th’ Doxology. It would ha’ listened\r\nto anything tha’d sung. It was th’ joy that mattered. Eh! lad,\r\nlad—what’s names to th’ Joy Maker,” and she gave his shoulders a quick\r\nsoft pat again.\r\n\r\nShe had packed a basket which held a regular feast this morning, and\r\nwhen the hungry hour came and Dickon brought it out from its hiding\r\nplace, she sat down with them under their tree and watched them devour\r\ntheir food, laughing and quite gloating over their appetites. She was\r\nfull of fun and made them laugh at all sorts of odd things. She told\r\nthem stories in broad Yorkshire and taught them new words. She laughed\r\nas if she could not help it when they told her of the increasing\r\ndifficulty there was in pretending that Colin was still a fretful\r\ninvalid.\r\n\r\n“You see we can’t help laughing nearly all the time when we are\r\ntogether,” explained Colin. “And it doesn’t sound ill at all. We try to\r\nchoke it back but it will burst out and that sounds worse than ever.”\r\n\r\n“There’s one thing that comes into my mind so often,” said Mary, “and I\r\ncan scarcely ever hold in when I think of it suddenly. I keep thinking\r\nsuppose Colin’s face should get to look like a full moon. It isn’t like\r\none yet but he gets a tiny bit fatter every day—and suppose some\r\nmorning it should look like one—what should we do!”\r\n\r\n“Bless us all, I can see tha’ has a good bit o’ play actin’ to do,”\r\nsaid Susan Sowerby. “But tha’ won’t have to keep it up much longer.\r\nMester Craven’ll come home.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think he will?” asked Colin. “Why?”\r\n\r\nSusan Sowerby chuckled softly.\r\n\r\n“I suppose it ’ud nigh break thy heart if he found out before tha’ told\r\nhim in tha’ own way,” she said. “Tha’s laid awake nights plannin’ it.”\r\n\r\n“I couldn’t bear anyone else to tell him,” said Colin. “I think about\r\ndifferent ways every day, I think now I just want to run into his\r\nroom.”\r\n\r\n“That’d be a fine start for him,” said Susan Sowerby. “I’d like to see\r\nhis face, lad. I would that! He mun come back—that he mun.”\r\n\r\nOne of the things they talked of was the visit they were to make to her\r\ncottage. They planned it all. They were to drive over the moor and\r\nlunch out of doors among the heather. They would see all the twelve\r\nchildren and Dickon’s garden and would not come back until they were\r\ntired.\r\n\r\nSusan Sowerby got up at last to return to the house and Mrs. Medlock.\r\nIt was time for Colin to be wheeled back also. But before he got into\r\nhis chair he stood quite close to Susan and fixed his eyes on her with\r\na kind of bewildered adoration and he suddenly caught hold of the fold\r\nof her blue cloak and held it fast.\r\n\r\n“You are just what I—what I wanted,” he said. “I wish you were my\r\nmother—as well as Dickon’s!”\r\n\r\nAll at once Susan Sowerby bent down and drew him with her warm arms\r\nclose against the bosom under the blue cloak—as if he had been Dickon’s\r\nbrother. The quick mist swept over her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Eh! dear lad!” she said. “Thy own mother’s in this ’ere very garden, I\r\ndo believe. She couldna’ keep out of it. Thy father mun come back to\r\nthee—he mun!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\nIN THE GARDEN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn each century since the beginning of the world wonderful things have\r\nbeen discovered. In the last century more amazing things were found out\r\nthan in any century before. In this new century hundreds of things\r\nstill more astounding will be brought to light. At first people refuse\r\nto believe that a strange new thing can be done, then they begin to\r\nhope it can be done, then they see it can be done—then it is done and\r\nall the world wonders why it was not done centuries ago. One of the new\r\nthings people began to find out in the last century was that\r\nthoughts—just mere thoughts—are as powerful as electric batteries—as\r\ngood for one as sunlight is, or as bad for one as poison. To let a sad\r\nthought or a bad one get into your mind is as dangerous as letting a\r\nscarlet fever germ get into your body. If you let it stay there after\r\nit has got in you may never get over it as long as you live.\r\n\r\nSo long as Mistress Mary’s mind was full of disagreeable thoughts about\r\nher dislikes and sour opinions of people and her determination not to\r\nbe pleased by or interested in anything, she was a yellow-faced,\r\nsickly, bored and wretched child. Circumstances, however, were very\r\nkind to her, though she was not at all aware of it. They began to push\r\nher about for her own good. When her mind gradually filled itself with\r\nrobins, and moorland cottages crowded with children, with queer crabbed\r\nold gardeners and common little Yorkshire housemaids, with springtime\r\nand with secret gardens coming alive day by day, and also with a moor\r\nboy and his “creatures,” there was no room left for the disagreeable\r\nthoughts which affected her liver and her digestion and made her yellow\r\nand tired.\r\n\r\nSo long as Colin shut himself up in his room and thought only of his\r\nfears and weakness and his detestation of people who looked at him and\r\nreflected hourly on humps and early death, he was a hysterical\r\nhalf-crazy little hypochondriac who knew nothing of the sunshine and\r\nthe spring and also did not know that he could get well and could stand\r\nupon his feet if he tried to do it. When new beautiful thoughts began\r\nto push out the old hideous ones, life began to come back to him, his\r\nblood ran healthily through his veins and strength poured into him like\r\na flood. His scientific experiment was quite practical and simple and\r\nthere was nothing weird about it at all. Much more surprising things\r\ncan happen to anyone who, when a disagreeable or discouraged thought\r\ncomes into his mind, just has the sense to remember in time and push it\r\nout by putting in an agreeable determinedly courageous one. Two things\r\ncannot be in one place.\r\n\r\n“Where you tend a rose, my lad,\r\nA thistle cannot grow.”\r\n\r\nWhile the secret garden was coming alive and two children were coming\r\nalive with it, there was a man wandering about certain far-away\r\nbeautiful places in the Norwegian fiords and the valleys and mountains\r\nof Switzerland and he was a man who for ten years had kept his mind\r\nfilled with dark and heart-broken thinking. He had not been courageous;\r\nhe had never tried to put any other thoughts in the place of the dark\r\nones. He had wandered by blue lakes and thought them; he had lain on\r\nmountain-sides with sheets of deep blue gentians blooming all about him\r\nand flower breaths filling all the air and he had thought them. A\r\nterrible sorrow had fallen upon him when he had been happy and he had\r\nlet his soul fill itself with blackness and had refused obstinately to\r\nallow any rift of light to pierce through. He had forgotten and\r\ndeserted his home and his duties. When he traveled about, darkness so\r\nbrooded over him that the sight of him was a wrong done to other people\r\nbecause it was as if he poisoned the air about him with gloom. Most\r\nstrangers thought he must be either half mad or a man with some hidden\r\ncrime on his soul. He, was a tall man with a drawn face and crooked\r\nshoulders and the name he always entered on hotel registers was,\r\n“Archibald Craven, Misselthwaite Manor, Yorkshire, England.”\r\n\r\nHe had traveled far and wide since the day he saw Mistress Mary in his\r\nstudy and told her she might have her “bit of earth.” He had been in\r\nthe most beautiful places in Europe, though he had remained nowhere\r\nmore than a few days. He had chosen the quietest and remotest spots. He\r\nhad been on the tops of mountains whose heads were in the clouds and\r\nhad looked down on other mountains when the sun rose and touched them\r\nwith such light as made it seem as if the world were just being born.\r\n\r\nBut the light had never seemed to touch himself until one day when he\r\nrealized that for the first time in ten years a strange thing had\r\nhappened. He was in a wonderful valley in the Austrian Tyrol and he had\r\nbeen walking alone through such beauty as might have lifted, any man’s\r\nsoul out of shadow. He had walked a long way and it had not lifted his.\r\nBut at last he had felt tired and had thrown himself down to rest on a\r\ncarpet of moss by a stream. It was a clear little stream which ran\r\nquite merrily along on its narrow way through the luscious damp\r\ngreenness. Sometimes it made a sound rather like very low laughter as\r\nit bubbled over and round stones. He saw birds come and dip their heads\r\nto drink in it and then flick their wings and fly away. It seemed like\r\na thing alive and yet its tiny voice made the stillness seem deeper.\r\nThe valley was very, very still.\r\n\r\nAs he sat gazing into the clear running of the water, Archibald Craven\r\ngradually felt his mind and body both grow quiet, as quiet as the\r\nvalley itself. He wondered if he were going to sleep, but he was not.\r\nHe sat and gazed at the sunlit water and his eyes began to see things\r\ngrowing at its edge. There was one lovely mass of blue forget-me-nots\r\ngrowing so close to the stream that its leaves were wet and at these he\r\nfound himself looking as he remembered he had looked at such things\r\nyears ago. He was actually thinking tenderly how lovely it was and what\r\nwonders of blue its hundreds of little blossoms were. He did not know\r\nthat just that simple thought was slowly filling his mind—filling and\r\nfilling it until other things were softly pushed aside. It was as if a\r\nsweet clear spring had begun to rise in a stagnant pool and had risen\r\nand risen until at last it swept the dark water away. But of course he\r\ndid not think of this himself. He only knew that the valley seemed to\r\ngrow quieter and quieter as he sat and stared at the bright delicate\r\nblueness. He did not know how long he sat there or what was happening\r\nto him, but at last he moved as if he were awakening and he got up\r\nslowly and stood on the moss carpet, drawing a long, deep, soft breath\r\nand wondering at himself. Something seemed to have been unbound and\r\nreleased in him, very quietly.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” he said, almost in a whisper, and he passed his hand over\r\nhis forehead. “I almost feel as if—I were alive!”\r\n\r\nI do not know enough about the wonderfulness of undiscovered things to\r\nbe able to explain how this had happened to him. Neither does anyone\r\nelse yet. He did not understand at all himself—but he remembered this\r\nstrange hour months afterward when he was at Misselthwaite again and he\r\nfound out quite by accident that on this very day Colin had cried out\r\nas he went into the secret garden:\r\n\r\n“I am going to live forever and ever and ever!”\r\n\r\nThe singular calmness remained with him the rest of the evening and he\r\nslept a new reposeful sleep; but it was not with him very long. He did\r\nnot know that it could be kept. By the next night he had opened the\r\ndoors wide to his dark thoughts and they had come trooping and rushing\r\nback. He left the valley and went on his wandering way again. But,\r\nstrange as it seemed to him, there were minutes—sometimes\r\nhalf-hours—when, without his knowing why, the black burden seemed to\r\nlift itself again and he knew he was a living man and not a dead one.\r\nSlowly—slowly—for no reason that he knew of—he was “coming alive” with\r\nthe garden.\r\n\r\nAs the golden summer changed into the deep golden autumn he went to the\r\nLake of Como. There he found the loveliness of a dream. He spent his\r\ndays upon the crystal blueness of the lake or he walked back into the\r\nsoft thick verdure of the hills and tramped until he was tired so that\r\nhe might sleep. But by this time he had begun to sleep better, he knew,\r\nand his dreams had ceased to be a terror to him.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” he thought, “my body is growing stronger.”\r\n\r\nIt was growing stronger but—because of the rare peaceful hours when his\r\nthoughts were changed—his soul was slowly growing stronger, too. He\r\nbegan to think of Misselthwaite and wonder if he should not go home.\r\nNow and then he wondered vaguely about his boy and asked himself what\r\nhe should feel when he went and stood by the carved four-posted bed\r\nagain and looked down at the sharply chiseled ivory-white face while it\r\nslept and, the black lashes rimmed so startlingly the close-shut eyes.\r\nHe shrank from it.\r\n\r\nOne marvel of a day he had walked so far that when he returned the moon\r\nwas high and full and all the world was purple shadow and silver. The\r\nstillness of lake and shore and wood was so wonderful that he did not\r\ngo into the villa he lived in. He walked down to a little bowered\r\nterrace at the water’s edge and sat upon a seat and breathed in all the\r\nheavenly scents of the night. He felt the strange calmness stealing\r\nover him and it grew deeper and deeper until he fell asleep.\r\n\r\nHe did not know when he fell asleep and when he began to dream; his\r\ndream was so real that he did not feel as if he were dreaming. He\r\nremembered afterward how intensely wide awake and alert he had thought\r\nhe was. He thought that as he sat and breathed in the scent of the late\r\nroses and listened to the lapping of the water at his feet he heard a\r\nvoice calling. It was sweet and clear and happy and far away. It seemed\r\nvery far, but he heard it as distinctly as if it had been at his very\r\nside.\r\n\r\n“Archie! Archie! Archie!” it said, and then again, sweeter and clearer\r\nthan before, “Archie! Archie!”\r\n\r\nHe thought he sprang to his feet not even startled. It was such a real\r\nvoice and it seemed so natural that he should hear it.\r\n\r\n“Lilias! Lilias!” he answered. “Lilias! where are you?”\r\n\r\n“In the garden,” it came back like a sound from a golden flute. “In the\r\ngarden!”\r\n\r\nAnd then the dream ended. But he did not awaken. He slept soundly and\r\nsweetly all through the lovely night. When he did awake at last it was\r\nbrilliant morning and a servant was standing staring at him. He was an\r\nItalian servant and was accustomed, as all the servants of the villa\r\nwere, to accepting without question any strange thing his foreign\r\nmaster might do. No one ever knew when he would go out or come in or\r\nwhere he would choose to sleep or if he would roam about the garden or\r\nlie in the boat on the lake all night. The man held a salver with some\r\nletters on it and he waited quietly until Mr. Craven took them. When he\r\nhad gone away Mr. Craven sat a few moments holding them in his hand and\r\nlooking at the lake. His strange calm was still upon him and something\r\nmore—a lightness as if the cruel thing which had been done had not\r\nhappened as he thought—as if something had changed. He was remembering\r\nthe dream—the real—real dream.\r\n\r\n“In the garden!” he said, wondering at himself. “In the garden! But the\r\ndoor is locked and the key is buried deep.”\r\n\r\nWhen he glanced at the letters a few minutes later he saw that the one\r\nlying at the top of the rest was an English letter and came from\r\nYorkshire. It was directed in a plain woman’s hand but it was not a\r\nhand he knew. He opened it, scarcely thinking of the writer, but the\r\nfirst words attracted his attention at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Dear Sir:_\r\n\r\nI am Susan Sowerby that made bold to speak to you once on the moor. It\r\nwas about Miss Mary I spoke. I will make bold to speak again. Please,\r\nsir, I would come home if I was you. I think you would be glad to come\r\nand—if you will excuse me, sir—I think your lady would ask you to come\r\nif she was here.\r\n\r\n    Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                Susan Sowerby.”\r\n\r\nMr. Craven read the letter twice before he put it back in its envelope.\r\nHe kept thinking about the dream.\r\n\r\n“I will go back to Misselthwaite,” he said. “Yes, I’ll go at once.”\r\n\r\nAnd he went through the garden to the villa and ordered Pitcher to\r\nprepare for his return to England.\r\n\r\nIn a few days he was in Yorkshire again, and on his long railroad\r\njourney he found himself thinking of his boy as he had never thought in\r\nall the ten years past. During those years he had only wished to forget\r\nhim. Now, though he did not intend to think about him, memories of him\r\nconstantly drifted into his mind. He remembered the black days when he\r\nhad raved like a madman because the child was alive and the mother was\r\ndead. He had refused to see it, and when he had gone to look at it at\r\nlast it had been, such a weak wretched thing that everyone had been\r\nsure it would die in a few days. But to the surprise of those who took\r\ncare of it the days passed and it lived and then everyone believed it\r\nwould be a deformed and crippled creature.\r\n\r\nHe had not meant to be a bad father, but he had not felt like a father\r\nat all. He had supplied doctors and nurses and luxuries, but he had\r\nshrunk from the mere thought of the boy and had buried himself in his\r\nown misery. The first time after a year’s absence he returned to\r\nMisselthwaite and the small miserable looking thing languidly and\r\nindifferently lifted to his face the great gray eyes with black lashes\r\nround them, so like and yet so horribly unlike the happy eyes he had\r\nadored, he could not bear the sight of them and turned away pale as\r\ndeath. After that he scarcely ever saw him except when he was asleep,\r\nand all he knew of him was that he was a confirmed invalid, with a\r\nvicious, hysterical, half-insane temper. He could only be kept from\r\nfuries dangerous to himself by being given his own way in every detail.\r\n\r\nAll this was not an uplifting thing to recall, but as the train whirled\r\nhim through mountain passes and golden plains the man who was “coming\r\nalive” began to think in a new way and he thought long and steadily and\r\ndeeply.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I have been all wrong for ten years,” he said to himself. “Ten\r\nyears is a long time. It may be too late to do anything—quite too late.\r\nWhat have I been thinking of!”\r\n\r\nOf course this was the wrong Magic—to begin by saying “too late.” Even\r\nColin could have told him that. But he knew nothing of Magic—either\r\nblack or white. This he had yet to learn. He wondered if Susan Sowerby\r\nhad taken courage and written to him only because the motherly creature\r\nhad realized that the boy was much worse—was fatally ill. If he had not\r\nbeen under the spell of the curious calmness which had taken possession\r\nof him he would have been more wretched than ever. But the calm had\r\nbrought a sort of courage and hope with it. Instead of giving way to\r\nthoughts of the worst he actually found he was trying to believe in\r\nbetter things.\r\n\r\n“Could it be possible that she sees that I may be able to do him good\r\nand control him?” he thought. “I will go and see her on my way to\r\nMisselthwaite.”\r\n\r\nBut when on his way across the moor he stopped the carriage at the\r\ncottage, seven or eight children who were playing about gathered in a\r\ngroup and bobbing seven or eight friendly and polite curtsies told him\r\nthat their mother had gone to the other side of the moor early in the\r\nmorning to help a woman who had a new baby. “Our Dickon,” they\r\nvolunteered, was over at the Manor working in one of the gardens where\r\nhe went several days each week.\r\n\r\nMr. Craven looked over the collection of sturdy little bodies and round\r\nred-cheeked faces, each one grinning in its own particular way, and he\r\nawoke to the fact that they were a healthy likable lot. He smiled at\r\ntheir friendly grins and took a golden sovereign from his pocket and\r\ngave it to “our ’Lizabeth Ellen” who was the oldest.\r\n\r\n“If you divide that into eight parts there will be half a crown for\r\neach of, you,” he said.\r\n\r\nThen amid grins and chuckles and bobbing of curtsies he drove away,\r\nleaving ecstasy and nudging elbows and little jumps of joy behind.\r\n\r\nThe drive across the wonderfulness of the moor was a soothing thing.\r\nWhy did it seem to give him a sense of homecoming which he had been\r\nsure he could never feel again—that sense of the beauty of land and sky\r\nand purple bloom of distance and a warming of the heart at drawing,\r\nnearer to the great old house which had held those of his blood for six\r\nhundred years? How he had driven away from it the last time, shuddering\r\nto think of its closed rooms and the boy lying in the four-posted bed\r\nwith the brocaded hangings. Was it possible that perhaps he might find\r\nhim changed a little for the better and that he might overcome his\r\nshrinking from him? How real that dream had been—how wonderful and\r\nclear the voice which called back to him, “In the garden—In the\r\ngarden!”\r\n\r\n“I will try to find the key,” he said. “I will try to open the door. I\r\nmust—though I don’t know why.”\r\n\r\nWhen he arrived at the Manor the servants who received him with the\r\nusual ceremony noticed that he looked better and that he did not go to\r\nthe remote rooms where he usually lived attended by Pitcher. He went\r\ninto the library and sent for Mrs. Medlock. She came to him somewhat\r\nexcited and curious and flustered.\r\n\r\n“How is Master Colin, Medlock?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Well, sir,” Mrs. Medlock answered, “he’s—he’s different, in a manner\r\nof speaking.”\r\n\r\n“Worse?” he suggested.\r\n\r\nMrs. Medlock really was flushed.\r\n\r\n“Well, you see, sir,” she tried to explain, “neither Dr. Craven, nor\r\nthe nurse, nor me can exactly make him out.”\r\n\r\n“Why is that?”\r\n\r\n“To tell the truth, sir, Master Colin might be better and he might be\r\nchanging for the worse. His appetite, sir, is past understanding—and\r\nhis ways—”\r\n\r\n“Has he become more—more peculiar?” her master, asked, knitting his\r\nbrows anxiously.\r\n\r\n“That’s it, sir. He’s growing very peculiar—when you compare him with\r\nwhat he used to be. He used to eat nothing and then suddenly he began\r\nto eat something enormous—and then he stopped again all at once and the\r\nmeals were sent back just as they used to be. You never knew, sir,\r\nperhaps, that out of doors he never would let himself be taken. The\r\nthings we’ve gone through to get him to go out in his chair would leave\r\na body trembling like a leaf. He’d throw himself into such a state that\r\nDr. Craven said he couldn’t be responsible for forcing him. Well, sir,\r\njust without warning—not long after one of his worst tantrums he\r\nsuddenly insisted on being taken out every day by Miss Mary and Susan\r\nSowerby’s boy Dickon that could push his chair. He took a fancy to both\r\nMiss Mary and Dickon, and Dickon brought his tame animals, and, if\r\nyou’ll credit it, sir, out of doors he will stay from morning until\r\nnight.”\r\n\r\n“How does he look?” was the next question.\r\n\r\n“If he took his food natural, sir, you’d think he was putting on\r\nflesh—but we’re afraid it may be a sort of bloat. He laughs sometimes\r\nin a queer way when he’s alone with Miss Mary. He never used to laugh\r\nat all. Dr. Craven is coming to see you at once, if you’ll allow him.\r\nHe never was as puzzled in his life.”\r\n\r\n“Where is Master Colin now?” Mr. Craven asked.\r\n\r\n“In the garden, sir. He’s always in the garden—though not a human\r\ncreature is allowed to go near for fear they’ll look at him.”\r\n\r\nMr. Craven scarcely heard her last words.\r\n\r\n“In the garden,” he said, and after he had sent Mrs. Medlock away he\r\nstood and repeated it again and again. “In the garden!”\r\n\r\nHe had to make an effort to bring himself back to the place he was\r\nstanding in and when he felt he was on earth again he turned and went\r\nout of the room. He took his way, as Mary had done, through the door in\r\nthe shrubbery and among the laurels and the fountain beds. The fountain\r\nwas playing now and was encircled by beds of brilliant autumn flowers.\r\nHe crossed the lawn and turned into the Long Walk by the ivied walls.\r\nHe did not walk quickly, but slowly, and his eyes were on the path. He\r\nfelt as if he were being drawn back to the place he had so long\r\nforsaken, and he did not know why. As he drew near to it his step\r\nbecame still more slow. He knew where the door was even though the ivy\r\nhung thick over it—but he did not know exactly where it lay—that buried\r\nkey.\r\n\r\nSo he stopped and stood still, looking about him, and almost the moment\r\nafter he had paused he started and listened—asking himself if he were\r\nwalking in a dream.\r\n\r\nThe ivy hung thick over the door, the key was buried under the shrubs,\r\nno human being had passed that portal for ten lonely years—and yet\r\ninside the garden there were sounds. They were the sounds of running\r\nscuffling feet seeming to chase round and round under the trees, they\r\nwere strange sounds of lowered suppressed voices—exclamations and\r\nsmothered joyous cries. It seemed actually like the laughter of young\r\nthings, the uncontrollable laughter of children who were trying not to\r\nbe heard but who in a moment or so—as their excitement mounted—would\r\nburst forth. What in heaven’s name was he dreaming of—what in heaven’s\r\nname did he hear? Was he losing his reason and thinking he heard things\r\nwhich were not for human ears? Was it that the far clear voice had\r\nmeant?\r\n\r\nAnd then the moment came, the uncontrollable moment when the sounds\r\nforgot to hush themselves. The feet ran faster and faster—they were\r\nnearing the garden door—there was quick strong young breathing and a\r\nwild outbreak of laughing shouts which could not be contained—and the\r\ndoor in the wall was flung wide open, the sheet of ivy swinging back,\r\nand a boy burst through it at full speed and, without seeing the\r\noutsider, dashed almost into his arms.\r\n\r\nMr. Craven had extended them just in time to save him from falling as a\r\nresult of his unseeing dash against him, and when he held him away to\r\nlook at him in amazement at his being there he truly gasped for breath.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall boy and a handsome one. He was glowing with life and his\r\nrunning had sent splendid color leaping to his face. He threw the thick\r\nhair back from his forehead and lifted a pair of strange gray eyes—eyes\r\nfull of boyish laughter and rimmed with black lashes like a fringe. It\r\nwas the eyes which made Mr. Craven gasp for breath.\r\n\r\n“Who—What? Who!” he stammered.\r\n\r\nThis was not what Colin had expected—this was not what he had planned.\r\nHe had never thought of such a meeting. And yet to come dashing\r\nout—winning a race—perhaps it was even better. He drew himself up to\r\nhis very tallest. Mary, who had been running with him and had dashed\r\nthrough the door too, believed that he managed to make himself look\r\ntaller than he had ever looked before—inches taller.\r\n\r\n“Father,” he said, “I’m Colin. You can’t believe it. I scarcely can\r\nmyself. I’m Colin.”\r\n\r\nLike Mrs. Medlock, he did not understand what his father meant when he\r\nsaid hurriedly:\r\n\r\n“In the garden! In the garden!”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” hurried on Colin. “It was the garden that did it—and Mary and\r\nDickon and the creatures—and the Magic. No one knows. We kept it to\r\ntell you when you came. I’m well, I can beat Mary in a race. I’m going\r\nto be an athlete.”\r\n\r\nHe said it all so like a healthy boy—his face flushed, his words\r\ntumbling over each other in his eagerness—that Mr. Craven’s soul shook\r\nwith unbelieving joy.\r\n\r\nColin put out his hand and laid it on his father’s arm.\r\n\r\n“Aren’t you glad, Father?” he ended. “Aren’t you glad? I’m going to\r\nlive forever and ever and ever!”\r\n\r\nMr. Craven put his hands on both the boy’s shoulders and held him\r\nstill. He knew he dared not even try to speak for a moment.\r\n\r\n“Take me into the garden, my boy,” he said at last. “And tell me all\r\nabout it.”\r\n\r\nAnd so they led him in.\r\n\r\nThe place was a wilderness of autumn gold and purple and violet blue\r\nand flaming scarlet and on every side were sheaves of late lilies\r\nstanding together—lilies which were white or white and ruby. He\r\nremembered well when the first of them had been planted that just at\r\nthis season of the year their late glories should reveal themselves.\r\nLate roses climbed and hung and clustered and the sunshine deepening\r\nthe hue of the yellowing trees made one feel that one, stood in an\r\nembowered temple of gold. The newcomer stood silent just as the\r\nchildren had done when they came into its grayness. He looked round and\r\nround.\r\n\r\n“I thought it would be dead,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Mary thought so at first,” said Colin. “But it came alive.”\r\n\r\nThen they sat down under their tree—all but Colin, who wanted to stand\r\nwhile he told the story.\r\n\r\nIt was the strangest thing he had ever heard, Archibald Craven thought,\r\nas it was poured forth in headlong boy fashion. Mystery and Magic and\r\nwild creatures, the weird midnight meeting—the coming of the spring—the\r\npassion of insulted pride which had dragged the young Rajah to his feet\r\nto defy old Ben Weatherstaff to his face. The odd companionship, the\r\nplay acting, the great secret so carefully kept. The listener laughed\r\nuntil tears came into his eyes and sometimes tears came into his eyes\r\nwhen he was not laughing. The Athlete, the Lecturer, the Scientific\r\nDiscoverer was a laughable, lovable, healthy young human thing.\r\n\r\n“Now,” he said at the end of the story, “it need not be a secret any\r\nmore. I dare say it will frighten them nearly into fits when they see\r\nme—but I am never going to get into the chair again. I shall walk back\r\nwith you, Father—to the house.”\r\n\r\nBen Weatherstaff’s duties rarely took him away from the gardens, but on\r\nthis occasion he made an excuse to carry some vegetables to the kitchen\r\nand being invited into the servants’ hall by Mrs. Medlock to drink a\r\nglass of beer he was on the spot—as he had hoped to be—when the most\r\ndramatic event Misselthwaite Manor had seen during the present\r\ngeneration actually took place.\r\n\r\nOne of the windows looking upon the courtyard gave also a glimpse of\r\nthe lawn. Mrs. Medlock, knowing Ben had come from the gardens, hoped\r\nthat he might have caught sight of his master and even by chance of his\r\nmeeting with Master Colin.\r\n\r\n“Did you see either of them, Weatherstaff?” she asked.\r\n\r\nBen took his beer-mug from his mouth and wiped his lips with the back\r\nof his hand.\r\n\r\n“Aye, that I did,” he answered with a shrewdly significant air.\r\n\r\n“Both of them?” suggested Mrs. Medlock.\r\n\r\n“Both of ’em,” returned Ben Weatherstaff. “Thank ye kindly, ma’am, I\r\ncould sup up another mug of it.”\r\n\r\n“Together?” said Mrs. Medlock, hastily overfilling his beer-mug in her\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n“Together, ma’am,” and Ben gulped down half of his new mug at one gulp.\r\n\r\n“Where was Master Colin? How did he look? What did they say to each\r\nother?”\r\n\r\n“I didna’ hear that,” said Ben, “along o’ only bein’ on th’ stepladder\r\nlookin over th’ wall. But I’ll tell thee this. There’s been things\r\ngoin’ on outside as you house people knows nowt about. An’ what tha’ll\r\nfind out tha’ll find out soon.”\r\n\r\nAnd it was not two minutes before he swallowed the last of his beer and\r\nwaved his mug solemnly toward the window which took in through the\r\nshrubbery a piece of the lawn.\r\n\r\n“Look there,” he said, “if tha’s curious. Look what’s comin’ across th’\r\ngrass.”\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Medlock looked she threw up her hands and gave a little\r\nshriek and every man and woman servant within hearing bolted across the\r\nservants’ hall and stood looking through the window with their eyes\r\nalmost starting out of their heads.\r\n\r\nAcross the lawn came the Master of Misselthwaite and he looked as many\r\nof them had never seen him. And by his side with his head up in the air\r\nand his eyes full of laughter walked as strongly and steadily as any\r\nboy in Yorkshire—Master Colin!\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 113 ***\r\n",
